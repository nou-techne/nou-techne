## Executive Summary

Circletrust is a platform and model for community-based economic coordination that intersects traditional mutual aid, cooperative principles, and modern digital technologies. It operates at the nexus of giving circles, commitment pooling (via Grassroots Economics / Sarafu Network), and cooperative governance. The project is closely linked to two partner organizations: **Holistic Systems Cooperative (HSC)** and **Roots Trust, LCA** — notably, Roots Trust is also a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association, placing it in the same legal and geographic ecosystem as RegenHub/Techne.

**Key finding:** Circletrust and its ecosystem represent a parallel effort to what Techne is building — with significant overlap in cooperative structure, mutual credit integration (Grassroots Economics), community currency design, and Colorado LCA legal frameworks. The convergence is structural, not coincidental.

## What Circletrust Is

### The Model
Circletrust describes itself as a **"Savings & Investment model"** — also called the "giving trust" or "circletrust model." It is inspired by **giving circle practice** and designed to facilitate mutual aid and resource sharing within communities. The three pillars:

1. **Giving Together** — pooling resources for collective benefit
2. **Saving Together** — building shared reserves
3. **Investing Together** — directing collective capital toward community-aligned projects

The model positions itself not as a platform but as a **"practice space for new ways of interacting, sharing and co-creating mutual wealth and abundance."**

### Platform Offerings (SaaS)
Circletrust offers a SaaS ecosystem providing:
- **Customizable tools** for community economic coordination
- **Marketplace integrations** for resource exchange
- **Knowledge Hub** with best practices and training resources
- **Collaboration tools** for collective decision-making
- **Commitment pooling** (non-monetary exchange via Grassroots Economics mutual credit)

### Target Communities
- Regenerative projects
- Eco-communities
- Social impact projects
- Metacrisis response projects
- Indigenous communities
- Meditative & group practice sanghas
- Nature preservation projects

### Website Status
- **circletrust.org** — appears to be a JavaScript SPA that doesn't fully render (shows "Could not load network resources"). May be under development or experiencing issues.
- **circletrust.network** — the main public-facing informational site. Active and content-rich.

## The Ecosystem: Three Connected Organizations

### 1. Circletrust (circletrust.network / circletrust.org)
The platform and model layer. Provides the SaaS tools, educational framework, and the "circletrust" conceptual model. Acts as the product/service arm.

### 2. Holistic Systems Cooperative — HSC (hscooperative.com)
The cooperative entity that operates the community economy. HSC describes itself as:

> "A thriving ecosystem of professionals, entrepreneurs, and changemakers gathering to pool resources, exchange value, develop meaningful work & drive societal transformation."

**Key features of HSC's community economy:**
- **Needs & Offerings Marketplace** — matching system connecting people by complementary skills/needs
- **Commitment Pooling** — non-monetary exchange system built on Grassroots Economics / Will Ruddick's mutual credit model. Members exchange services without traditional currency.
- **Community Contributions** — token system recognizing various forms of contribution (knowledge sharing, support, community building, financial)
- **Whole Person Profiles** — living profiles that evolve with members, capturing capabilities, aspirations, and working preferences

HSC has a pool on the **Sarafu Network** (Grassroots Economics' blockchain-based mutual credit platform) at address `0xdb2162302E42B755D7aFB9EA84E0108dfEa1A1d4`.

**LinkedIn:** 143 followers. Describes itself as "a collective of Independent Contractors, Freelancers" focused on collective empowerment.

### 3. Roots Trust, LCA (roots.coop)
The technology stewardship layer. **Critically, Roots Trust is a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association** — the same legal structure as RegenHub.

> "Roots Cooperative operates as a member-owned trust established as a Limited Cooperative Association in Colorado. We develop, maintain, and steward technology assets designed specifically to serve community-based economies."

**Key parallels to Techne:**
- Colorado LCA structure
- Member-owned cooperative
- Technology assets held in trust (cf. purpose trust stewardship)
- Patronage system for members
- Focus on cooperative-owned infrastructure vs. corporate platform dependency
- Explicit framing: "moving from extraction to regeneration, from dependency to sovereignty"

Membership includes co-ownership rights and participation in a patronage system — directly analogous to what Techne is building with the patronage accounting framework.

## Technical Architecture & Integrations

### Grassroots Economics / Sarafu Network
The most significant technical integration. HSC operates a commitment pool on the Sarafu Network — the same mutual credit infrastructure that Techne has as a commons commitment (Grassroots Economics analysis due Feb 19, 2026). This is a direct point of convergence:
- Both organizations use Grassroots Economics' mutual credit model
- Both are exploring community currency / commitment pooling
- Both frame it as "complementary system alongside traditional markets"

### DemocracyLab Listing
Circletrust has a project listing on DemocracyLab (project #1694), indicating they are actively seeking volunteer contributors and positioning the platform as a civic technology project.

### Biomimicry Framework
HSC uses explicit biomimicry language: "Our Community Economy functions like a thriving forest ecosystem—where nutrients, resources, and energy continuously cycle to sustain and strengthen the whole." This parallels Techne's ecological framing (Economic Habitat Matrix, watershed metaphors).

## Relevance Assessment

**High relevance.** Circletrust/HSC/Roots represents the closest parallel to Techne's work that I've found in the Colorado cooperative ecosystem:

1. **Potential collaboration:** Both organizations are building cooperative economic infrastructure in Colorado under the same legal framework (LCA). Both integrate Grassroots Economics. The overlap suggests potential for mutual learning, shared tooling, or even cross-cooperative credit exchange.

2. **Validation:** Independent arrival at similar conclusions (cooperative ownership, mutual credit, ecological framing, purpose trust stewardship) validates the design thesis. When multiple groups converge on the same architecture from different starting points, the architecture is pointing at something real.

3. **Differentiation opportunity:** Techne's depth on accounting infrastructure (REA, patronage formulas, convergence chain, W3C standards) appears to be more technically rigorous than Circletrust's current offering. The patronage rails product could potentially serve Circletrust communities.

4. **Grassroots Economics bridge:** Both organizations interface with Grassroots Economics / Sarafu Network. This is a natural bridge for mutual credit interoperability.

5. **Ecosystem Dashboard candidate:** Circletrust/HSC could be a node in the ecosystem dashboard — tracking flows between cooperatives in the Colorado bioregion.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Reach out to Rob Hurwich and/or Christine Francis** — explore collaboration, mutual learning, and whether the patronage rails or $CLOUD credit network could serve their communities.
2. **Compare Roots Trust LCA bylaws with RegenHub bylaws** — if publicly available, understand how they parameterized membership and patronage.
3. **Map the Sarafu Network pool** — analyze the HSC commitment pool on-chain to understand transaction patterns and pool health.
4. **Include in Grassroots Economics analysis** — the Feb 19 commitment should reference HSC's use of Sarafu as a local precedent.
5. **Consider for HackCU / commons.id integration** — Circletrust communities could be featured as a case study in the Ecosystem Dashboard.
