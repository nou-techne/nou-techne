# World of Workcraft — Presentation Deck

*A distributed cooperative ecosystem game design*

---

## Slide 1: Title

# World of Workcraft
## Distributed Cooperative Ecosystems

How hubs become forests. **Craft** becomes identity. **Communication** becomes structure.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Hierarchies centralize power
One organization controls everyone. Autonomy is lost.

### Silos fragment knowledge
Communities can't see each other. Collaboration requires permission.

### Centralized data is vulnerable
One company holds your data. Outages affect everyone.

### Value concentrates
Economic power doesn't flow to the people.

**Can we coordinate without centralizing?**

---

## Slide 3: From Tree to Forest

Each hub is a **tree** — rooted in place, autonomous, complete.

Together, hubs form a **forest** — connected peer-to-peer, sharing resources without top-down control.

### The Hubs

- **Techne** — Boulder, Colorado
- **Nairobi** — Kenya  
- **Zurich** — Switzerland

---

## Slide 4: The Seven Layers

Every hub is organized through seven lenses. Together they hold the whole.

| Layer | What It Holds |
|-------|--------------|
| **e/ Ecology** | Watershed, place, season — the land itself |
| **H/ Human** | Members, contributors, stewards — the people |
| **L/ Language** | Shared vocabulary, how things are named |
| **A/ Artifacts** | Projects, documents, tools — durable work |
| **M/ Methodology** | Governance, coordination, how decisions flow |
| **T/ Training** | Learning, knowledge commons — how community grows |
| **S/ Sessions** | Gatherings, meetings, where convergence happens |

---

## Slide 5: Craft & Specialization

You choose two crafts: what you shape + what shapes you.

### The Eight Crafts

1. **Code** — Systems, logic, automation
2. **Word** — Language, narrative, law
3. **Form** — Shape, space, the visible
4. **Sound** — Vibration, rhythm, the heard
5. **Earth** — Land, growth, materials
6. **Body** — Movement, presence, health
7. **Fire** — Energy, transformation, catalysis
8. **Water** — Connection, flow, care

**8 crafts × 8 archetypes = 64 starting points**

After 20 contributions, your archetype specializes into one of six paths. Your craft journey becomes visible.

## Slide 6: Communication Layers

Four levels of coordination, each with clear scope and consent.

### 1. Local Channels
- `#watershed-updates`
- `#introductions`
- `#project-updates`
- **Fully local, private**

### 2. Inter-Hub Bridges
- Techne ↔ Nairobi
- `#shared-ventures`
- `#knowledge-exchange`
- **Bilateral consent required**

### 3. Guild Chambers
- Guild of the Loom (Code)
- `#infrastructure-standards`
- `#craft-innovation`
- **Global craft community**

### 4. Forest Council
- Ecosystem governance
- $CLOUD mechanics
- Chain standards
- **One hub, one vote**

---

## Slide 7: The Pollination Network

A cross-hub venture: protecting pollinators across North America and Africa.

| Name | Hub | Archetype | Role |
|------|-----|-----------|------|
| **Maya** | Techne | Terraformer – Beekeeper | Sensor networks & monitoring |
| **Ahmed** | Nairobi | Navigator – Connector | Cross-hub coordination |
| **Keisha** | Techne | Grower – Restorer | Field research & ecology |
| **Kwame** | Accra | Beekeeper – Guardian | Local protection & advocacy |

No centralization. No VC. Local autonomy. Transparent patronage. Shared ownership.

---

## Slide 8: Digital Infrastructure Trust

### Who holds the data? Who controls availability? Who decides access?

### 🏛️ Democratic Ownership
One member, one vote. Members of the trust are members of hubs.

### 📍 Data Locality
Your data stays in your region. Boulder data stays in Colorado. Encrypted backups only.

### 💸 Cost Recovery
Services priced at cost + 10% reserve fund. Surplus returned to members as credits.

### 🚪 Exit Right
Leave anytime with 60 days notice. Your data is exported in open format.

**Hubs hold their own data. The Trust provides infrastructure cooperatively.**

---

## Slide 9: Governance by Design

### Local (Hub)
Full autonomy. Who are members. Patronage formula. Which ventures to support.

### Bridge (Two Hubs)
Bilateral consent. What coordination is needed. How to split costs and revenue.

### Guild (Global Craft)
Consensus-seeking. Best practices and standards. Specialization definitions.

### Forest (Ecosystem)
One hub, one vote. Any hub can veto. Affects shared infrastructure.

**Conflicts are expensive. Exit is easy. Incentive: cooperate.**

---

## Slide 10: Why This Matters

### Locally Rooted
Each hub thrives in its specific place. Ecology matters. Community matters.

### Globally Coordinated
Hubs see each other. Knowledge flows. Problems are shared. Leverage increases.

### Economically Just
Value flows based on contribution, not concentration. Patronage over capital.

### Resilient
No single point of failure. Exit is always an option. The system survives disagreement.

---

## Slide 11: The Forest Is Being Planted

### Distributed coordination.
### Visible rules.
### Clear progression.
### Real stakes.

The world is real. The stakes are real. The forest grows together.
