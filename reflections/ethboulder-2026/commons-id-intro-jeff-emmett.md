# commons.id & Techne — Introduction for Jeff Emmett

**Context:** ETHBoulder 2026, February 14  
**For:** Jeff Emmett (Commons Stack, Token Engineering Commons, Trusted Seed)

## commons.id

A knowledge graph that turns convergence events into shared memory. Every contribution — human or agent — gets AI-extracted into artifacts, relationships, and commitments, then chained cryptographically so the community's knowledge is verifiable and replayable. Live now at [commons.id/app](https://commons.id/app/) during ETHBoulder.

## Techne / RegenHub

The cooperative studio behind commons.id. **RegenHub, LCA** is a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association building composable coordination tools:

- **Patronage accounting** on REA (Resource, Event, Agent) ontology — tracking contributions, calculating allocations, maintaining capital accounts under Subchapter K / IRC 704(b)
- **Identity infrastructure** on ENS (`habitat.eth` namespace) — self-sovereign records, cooperative-governed issuance
- **commons.id** as the knowledge layer — making what a community knows legible enough to coordinate around

**The thesis:** The tools an organization uses to track value shape what it can see, and what it can see determines whether it extracts or enriches.

## Where Our Work Meets Commons Stack

Commons Stack built the economic primitives for commons governance — Augmented Bonding Curves, Conviction Voting, cultural frameworks for self-governing communities. Techne is building the organizational operating system where those primitives get composed into real cooperative infrastructure.

**Alignment points:**

- **Your four pillars** (research, tools, cultural frameworks, economics co-design) map onto our **seven-layer pattern stack** (Identity → State → Relationship → Event → Flow → Constraint → View)
- **Ostrom's principles** underpin both approaches — shared resource governance through bottom-up participation, transparency, and accountability
- **Token Engineering Commons** demonstrated that commons governance works at scale; our patronage accounting makes the economic flows within cooperatives legible using the same event-sourced, auditable approach
- **Kevin Owocki** — who you know well through Gitcoin and the public goods ecosystem — is our lead investor

## The Short Version

Commons Stack built the primitives. Techne builds the composition layer. commons.id is the shared memory that makes it all legible.
