# The Soil Beneath the Protocol: A Techne Reflection

**In response to:** [An Open Letter to the Ethereum Community on the Topic of the Protocol Underground](the-protocol-underground.md) by @theopenmachine

We read TheOpenSystem's letter as people who build in the gap it names.

Techne is a cooperative studio at a studio space in Boulder — a Limited Cooperative Association formed to cultivate what we call *scenius*: the collective intelligence that emerges when culturally aligned people share sustained proximity. We operate a venture studio, but that description misses the point the way "distributed ledger" misses the point of Ethereum. What we actually do is tend conditions. We are soil, not plant.

The letter's central insight — that the meta-protocols of underground culture *are* the alignment values Ethereum claims — lands for us not as theory but as lived operational reality. We know this because we've been trying to encode it.

## Where the Letter Meets the Ledger

TheOpenSystem identifies five meta-protocols of the underground:

- Distributed agency over passivity
- Aesthetic co-creation over spectatorship
- Affirmed consent against coercion
- Processuality against binary thinking
- Open documentation against enclosure

We recognize these. They are the design constraints of our patronage accounting system — the infrastructure we're building to make cooperative economic relationships legible without making them capturable. Every accounting system embeds an ontology of value. Most encode extraction by default: they track what's taken, not what's given. They make private accumulation visible and mutual contribution invisible.

We chose a different grammar. REA — Resource, Event, Agent — tracks economic activity as *flows between agents*, not balances in private accounts. When we pair this with cooperative patronage accounting under Subchapter K, the result is infrastructure where contribution is the primary unit of legibility. Not ownership. Not extraction. Contribution.

This is what it looks like when the meta-protocols become operational: distributed agency encoded in multi-stakeholder governance. Co-creation encoded in patronage allocation formulas that weight labor alongside capital. Consent encoded in member-controlled agreements. Processuality encoded in event sourcing — every state is a history, revisitable, forkable, never final. Open documentation encoded in the Peer Production License that governs our tools.

We didn't arrive at these patterns through the underground, though many of us have passed through its various precincts. We arrived at them through the cooperative tradition — which the letter might recognize as the protocol underground's most successful and most overlooked fork.

## The Cooperative Tradition as Protocol Underground

The letter traces open protocolization from the twenties through the nineties, finding its furnace in marginalization and its maturity in ethics. We'd extend the timeline. The Rochdale Pioneers codified cooperative principles in 1844 — open membership, democratic control, member economic participation, autonomy, education, cooperation among cooperatives, concern for community. These aren't business rules. They're meta-protocols. They arose from the same furnace: textile workers in industrial England, legally and economically marginalized, discovering that the only option was reproduction through free circulation of both goods and governance.

The cooperative movement did what the letter describes: it treated alienation from institutions as a virtue. It built parallel infrastructure. It protocolized. And like the underground cultures the letter names, its ethical codes emerged from logistical necessity — mutual aid as survival strategy becoming mutual aid as way of life.

Colorado's Limited Cooperative Association statute, under which Techne operates, is itself an expression of this: a legal protocol designed to let cooperative and investor interests coexist without the cooperative ceding governance to capital. The protocol underground has always had its legislators, even if they didn't know they were writing code.

## Scenius and the Coalitionary Possible

The letter asks: who are the makers, technologists, protocolists following alignment values outside the Ethereum ecosystem? And it proposes the *coalitionary possible* as a frame for finding them.

We think the frame is right but the verb is wrong. You don't *find* the coalitionary possible. You *cultivate* it. It requires a place, a practice, and time. Scenius — Brian Eno's term for the communal form of genius — doesn't emerge from mapping compatible actors. It emerges from proximity, friction, shared meals, repeated encounters, the slow accumulation of trust that can't be airdropped.

This is why Techne is a physical space with a kitchen and not a Discord server with a multisig. This is why Ethereum localism must be *local* — not as limitation but as discipline. The underground cultures the letter celebrates didn't circulate as abstractions. Detroit house came from specific basements in a specific city hollowed out by specific economic forces. Portland's own contributions to this lineage — and they are real — came from specific houses, specific venues, specific weather.

When the letter speaks of "showing up to learn," we'd add: showing up *somewhere*. At a specific altitude, in a specific watershed, with specific people who will still be there next week. The coalitionary possible becomes actual through commitment to place.

## Where We Go Together

TheOpenSystem speaks from Portland. Techne speaks from Boulder. These are two points in a mountain west corridor that shares more than geography — a shared attunement to the tension between rapid growth and the older, slower protocols of the land itself.

We read this letter as an invitation, and we accept it in the specific terms the letter itself proposes: not as missionaries but as practitioners of reciprocity. We offer:

**What we're building:** Composable coordination tools — patronage accounting, identity infrastructure, knowledge graphs — designed for the coalitionary possible. Open source, cooperatively governed, built on the seven progressive design patterns we've identified as the compositional grammar of information systems.

**What we're practicing:** The ordeal of reciprocity at the scale of a single building. Multi-stakeholder governance. Transparent economics. The daily discipline of making collective intelligence operational rather than aspirational.

**What we're learning:** That the gap between protocol and practice is where the actual work lives. That underground cultures have been doing this work for a century. That Ethereum's hardness — its capacity to persist state beyond any single institution — is genuinely new and genuinely needed. And that none of it matters without the slower, deeper protocols of trust, presence, and place.

The protocol underground doesn't need Ethereum to exist. It has existed for a hundred years without it. But Ethereum can offer what the underground has always lacked: persistence beyond the memory of its practitioners. A ledger that doesn't forget when the scene moves on. Infrastructure for the scenius to outlive any single generation of participants.

In return, the underground offers Ethereum what it desperately needs: legitimacy that can't be bought, alignment that was tested in the furnace of real marginalization, and the deep knowledge that open protocols are not an invention of computer science but an ancient human technology for surviving — and thriving beyond — institutional capture.

We're here. Third floor, the studio, Boulder. The door is open.
