# Project: Sundance Boulder — RegenHub Venue Activation

## Lead
Jon Bo (@jondotbo)

## Context
Sundance Film Festival is expanding to Boulder. This is an early-mover opportunity to position RegenHub/Techne as a go-to indie/creative-aligned venue for activations, screenings, and brand experiences during the festival.

## The Opportunity
- Boulder's Sundance venue market is **unestablished** — first movers set the terms.
- RegenHub's identity (independent, cooperative, creative) aligns naturally with Sundance's brand.
- Multi-floor setup enables a **split model**: coworking stays operational (2nd floor) while event/activation space (3rd floor + rooftop) generates premium revenue.

## Positioning
**Not just square footage — alignment.**
RegenHub is a venue that *makes sense* for brands, filmmakers, and activations signaling creative independence over corporate pop-up. Plus: AI-integrated production support (vibecoded event sites, real-time content) as a differentiator no other Boulder space can offer.

## Pricing
- Boulder coworking baseline: ~$105/hr (Peerspace average, range $17-$285/hr)
- Sundance premium: 3-5x baseline → $300-500/hr for curated creative space with rooftop
- **Gallery owner model**: Rent out primary space, bank significant revenue, members use reserved area

## Action Items

### Immediate
- [ ] Contact **Downtown Boulder Partnership (DBP)** — coordination hub, attended 2026 Park City festival
- [ ] Email **partner@bouldercvb.com** (Axios/CVB)
- [ ] **Document the space**: Professional photos, floor plans, capacity numbers, A/V specs
- [ ] List on **Peerspace / Giggster / LiquidSpace**

### Near-Term
- [ ] Build relationships with **event production companies** and **brand activation agencies**
- [ ] Develop one-pager for outreach (space specs, pricing, the Techne differentiator)
- [ ] Research Sundance Boulder timeline and official venue application process

### Strategic
- [ ] Design the **split model** — which spaces stay member-accessible, which become event rental
- [ ] Define **Techne value-add packages** (AI production support, vibecoded event assets)
- [ ] Explore partnerships with other Boulder venues for a "creative corridor" offering

## Key Contacts
- Downtown Boulder Partnership (DBP)
- Boulder CVB (partner@bouldercvb.com)
- Event production companies (TBD)
- Brand activation agencies (TBD)

## Revenue Potential
TBD — depends on duration of festival, number of activations, and whether we secure anchor clients vs. hourly rentals. Park City comparables suggest significant upside.

## Status
**Phase: Research & Outreach** (Feb 2026)
