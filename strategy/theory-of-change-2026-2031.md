## 1. Executive Summary

RegenHub is a cooperative venture studio in Boulder, Colorado that provides infrastructure — space, legal structure, planning, capital access — for autonomous ventures building at the intersection of cooperative economics and decentralized technology. Our core thesis is that all information systems decompose into a progressive set of design patterns (the Seven-Layer Pattern Stack), and that compositional fluency with these patterns is the durable competitive advantage of the 21st century. We are not a startup. We are soil. Over five years, we intend to prove that a cooperatively-owned venture studio can generate compounding returns — financial, intellectual, and communal — by treating knowledge as a commons and craft as the moat.

## 2. Theory of Change

### The Problem

The dominant model for building technology ventures concentrates ownership, extracts value from communities, and produces tools that optimize for engagement over augmentation. Boulder sits at the confluence of deep technical talent, entrepreneurial energy, and progressive values — yet most of that energy flows through conventional structures (accelerators, VC-backed startups) that replicate extractive patterns. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ecosystem has proven that new coordination mechanisms are possible but struggles to translate protocol-level innovation into local, embodied community.

The gap: there is no infrastructure connecting cooperative ownership, physical community, and the compositional patterns that underlie all information systems. People who want to build differently lack the soil to grow in.

### The Intervention

Techne operates as a venture studio structured as a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association. We provide:

- **Physical space** — a third-floor commons in Boulder where people work, learn, and build together
- **Legal and financial infrastructure** — cooperative formation, patronage accounting, $CLOUD credit system, investor-member structures
- **A pattern library** — a cooperative commons encoding the compositional patterns (Identity → State → Relationship → Event → Flow → Constraint → View) that recur across every information system
- **Education** — LearnVibe.Build cohorts that develop compositional fluency from first principles through production deployment
- **Venture support** — scoping, planning, and back-office services for autonomous ventures that engage with the cooperative

### Mechanisms of Change

1. **Compositional fluency compounds.** Each venture that passes through the studio refines the pattern library. The next venture scopes faster. The library gets richer. This is not a linear process — it's a flywheel.

2. **Cooperative structure recirculates value.** Patronage accounting (40% labor, 30% revenue, 20% cash, 10% community) ensures surplus flows back to the people who created it, weighted toward contribution rather than capital.

3. **Physical proximity generates scenius.** Remote work is efficient. Co-located creative work is generative. The third floor is where serendipitous collisions happen — the kind that produce ventures, not just products.

4. **Education creates membership pipeline.** Students who complete LVB cohorts want to stay. They become members. Members become venture leads. Venture leads refine the pattern library. The cycle continues.

5. **Cosmo-local principle bridges scales.** Knowledge and patterns are globally shared (light global). Physical space, relationships, and governance are locally rooted (heavy local). This resolves the tension between open-source abundance and sustainable local economics.

### Desired Long-Term Impact

A proven, replicable model for cooperative venture infrastructure that demonstrates you don't have to choose between economic sustainability and democratic ownership. By 2031, Techne should be one node in a network of similar studios — each locally rooted, globally connected through shared pattern libraries and cooperative protocols.

---

## 3. Vision (2031)

Five years from now:

- **Techne has supported 15–20 ventures**, several of which are self-sustaining and contributing back through the 1% reciprocity commitment. The pattern library is rich, well-documented, and used by studios beyond Boulder.
- **The cooperative has 50+ cooperative members** with functioning democratic governance, transparent patronage distributions, and a track record of fair surplus allocation.
- **LearnVibe.Build has graduated 500+ students** across all three levels, with a measurable pipeline from education to membership to venture creation.
- **$CLOUD credits are a functioning internal economy**, with the Financial Engineering Committee having parameterized staking curves and patronage distributions that other cooperatives study and adapt.
- **The physical space has expanded** from the third floor to a vertical ecosystem spanning multiple floors, with the roof as a community gathering commons.
- **commons.id is the knowledge infrastructure** for a network of convergence events and cooperative ventures, demonstrating that knowledge graphs can be governed as commons.
- **The model has been forked.** At least 3 other cities have adapted the RegenHub structure — not because we franchised it, but because the pattern library and legal templates made it possible.

## 4. Mission

To cultivate scenius by providing cooperative infrastructure — space, patterns, capital, and community — for ventures that augment human capability rather than extract human attention.

---

## 5. Strategic Pillars

### Pillar 1: The Commons (Pattern Library & Knowledge Infrastructure)

The pattern library is the cooperative's core intellectual asset. It is not proprietary — it is a commons, governed by the cooperative, enriched by every venture.

**Objectives:**
- Formalize the Seven-Layer Pattern Stack into a documented, versioned library by end of Year 1
- Integrate the pattern library with commons.id as the living archive
- Establish contribution norms: every venture that uses the library contributes refinements back
- Publish the Economic Habitat Matrix as a diagnostic tool for organizational self-awareness
- Build the Ecosystem Dashboard for tracking fundamentals across Gitcoin/Allo/RegenHub/Techne

### Pillar 2: Education & Capability Development (H-LAM/T)

LearnVibe.Build is the capability engine. It develops compositional fluency — the ability to see, name, and compose the patterns that underlie information systems. Grounded in Engelbart's H-LAM/T framework: Human, Language, Artifacts, Methodology, Training.

**Objectives:**
- Run 4 LVB cohort cycles per year across all three levels (LEARN/VIBE/BUILD)
- Develop continuing education and workshop offerings for alumni
- Create a membership pathway: student → community member → co-working member → cooperative member
- Document pedagogy so it can be adapted by other studios
- Maintain a 1:3 instructor-to-student ratio at the BUILD level

### Pillar 3: Venture Infrastructure (Soil, Not Plant)

Techne is not an accelerator. We don't take equity in the conventional sense. We provide infrastructure and receive reciprocity — 1% commitment from ventures, plus the compounding value of pattern library refinement.

**Objectives:**
- Support 3–5 new ventures per year by Year 2
- Provide formation assistance, business planning, and back-office services
- Maintain clear boundaries: ventures are autonomous, not subsidiaries
- Track venture health without controlling venture direction
- Develop service packages at transparent, published rates

### Pillar 4: Cooperative Economics & Financial Innovation

The financial infrastructure is where RegenHub's unique contribution lives. Combining Colorado LCA law, IRC 704(b) patronage accounting, REA event-sourcing, and $CLOUD credits into a coherent system that other cooperatives can learn from.

**Objectives:**
- Stand up the Financial Engineering Committee post-ETHBoulder (Feb 2026)
- Parameterize the patronage allocation formula and publish methodology
- Implement $CLOUD credit minting and staking along the compounding curve
- Achieve first patronage distribution by end of Year 1
- Document the investor-member class structure as a replicable legal pattern (building on SporkDAO precedent)

### Pillar 5: Place & Community (Boulder as Laboratory)

The physical space is not incidental. Boulder — where the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains — is a specific place with specific energy. The Ethereum localism movement, Open Civics, Spirit of the Front Range — these are not abstract networks, they are people who show up.

**Objectives:**
- Establish the third floor as Boulder's primary space for cooperative technology work
- Host monthly community events and quarterly convergence gatherings
- Develop the vertical ecosystem: third floor (studio), second floor (coworking), roof (community)
- Anchor ETHBoulder as a recurring event connecting global Ethereum ecosystem to local community
- Build relationships with Boulder's broader cooperative and civic ecosystem

## 6. Year-by-Year Roadmap

### Year 1: Foundation (2026)

**Theme:** Prove the model works. Ship the basics. Build trust.

- Complete third-floor buildout (commons, teaching space, studio, quiet room, sauna/cold plunge)
- Run LVB Cohorts 2–4 across all levels
- Host ETHBoulder (Feb 2026) and establish it as recurring
- Stand up Financial Engineering Committee
- Formalize pattern library v1.0
- First patronage allocation (even if small — the precedent matters)
- Implement $CLOUD credit system (Mercury integration, minting, basic staking)
- Reach 20 community members, 10 co-working members, 5 cooperative members
- Launch Ecosystem Dashboard MVP
- commons.id: expand from MVP to support multiple convergence events
- Parachute: support Aaron Gabriel's venture through first external users

**Revenue target:** Cover operating costs (rent, utilities, basic operations) through combined space + education + service revenue. The $100K investment covers the gap.

### Year 2: Growth (2027)

**Theme:** Flywheel starts turning. Education pipeline feeds membership. First ventures mature.

- Support 3–5 new ventures through the studio
- LVB alumni network reaches 100+ graduates
- Second-floor coworking space operational
- First venture reciprocity revenue (1% commitments begin flowing)
- Patronage distribution becomes routine (quarterly)
- $CLOUD staking curve refined based on Year 1 data
- Pattern library v2.0 with contributions from 5+ ventures
- Reach 50 community members, 20 co-working members, 10 cooperative members
- Host 2 convergence events via commons.id
- First external cooperative studies RegenHub's financial model

**Revenue target:** Operating costs covered by organic revenue. Investment capital preserved as reserve.

### Year 3: Scale (2028)

**Theme:** Model is proven. Begin documenting for replication. Deepen financial innovation.

- 8–12 ventures supported to date, 3+ self-sustaining
- LVB offerings expand: specialized workshops, corporate training, visiting instructors
- Roof space developed as community commons
- $CLOUD credit system mature: bridge token model operational, shadow pricing documented
- Pattern library adopted by at least 1 external organization
- Cooperative membership at 25+, governance fully democratic
- Begin publishing "how to fork this" documentation
- Ecosystem Dashboard tracking cross-organization fundamentals in real-time
- habitat.eth namespace serving as identity layer for member ecosystem

**Revenue target:** Surplus generated. Patronage distributions meaningful (not token).

### Years 4–5: Maturity (2029–2031)

**Theme:** Network effects. The model replicates. Techne becomes one node among many.

- 15–20 ventures supported total, venture reciprocity as significant revenue stream
- At least 2 other cities adapting the RegenHub/Techne model
- Pattern library is a recognized resource in the cooperative technology space
- LVB alumni network at 500+, with alumni teaching and creating ventures
- Financial model fully documented, audited, and published as open-source legal/accounting templates
- Cooperative has weathered at least one significant challenge (market downturn, key person departure, governance dispute) and emerged stronger
- The question shifts from "can this work?" to "where else can this work?"

## 7. Revenue Model Evolution

### Year 1 (2026)

| Stream | % of Revenue | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Space (rent, events) | 35% | Third floor sublease, event hosting |
| Education (LVB) | 40% | 4 cohort cycles × 3 levels |
| Services | 20% | Formation, planning, back-office |
| Venture reciprocity | 5% | Minimal — ventures still maturing |

*Investment capital ($100K) bridges any gap. Target: minimize bridge draw.*

### Year 2 (2027)

| Stream | % of Revenue | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Space | 30% | Second floor adds capacity |
| Education | 35% | Recurring cohorts + workshops |
| Services | 20% | Expanding client base |
| Venture reciprocity | 10% | First 1% commitments flowing |
| $CLOUD / staking | 5% | Early credit system revenue |

### Year 3+ (2028–2031)

| Stream | % of Revenue | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Space | 20% | Stable, predictable base |
| Education | 25% | Mature program, alumni teaching |
| Services | 15% | Efficient, pattern-library-driven |
| Venture reciprocity | 25% | Compounding as ventures mature |
| $CLOUD / financial services | 10% | Staking, credit system |
| Replication licensing / consulting | 5% | Other cooperatives adapting model |

The key shift: from space-and-education-heavy (Year 1) to venture-reciprocity-heavy (Year 3+). This is the flywheel — venture success feeds cooperative surplus, which funds more venture support.

---

## 8. Governance Evolution

### Phase 1: Founding Team (2026)

- Todd Youngblood as Ventures & Operations Steward
- Kevin Owocki and Jeremy as investor members
- Aaron Gabriel and Jeff Pote as key contributors
- Governance by consent among founding team
- Operating agreement establishes member classes and decision rights
- Cooperative members have voting authority; investor members have economic rights and advisory voice

### Phase 2: Emerging Democracy (2027)

- First cooperative members beyond founders elected/admitted
- Standing committees formed: Financial Engineering, Education, Ventures, Community
- Quarterly member meetings with transparent financial reporting
- Patronage allocation formula in active use, subject to member review
- Conflict resolution process documented and tested

### Phase 3: Full Cooperative Democracy (2028–2029)

- Cooperative members exceed founding team
- Board elected by cooperative members
- Steward roles rotate or are elected, not appointed
- Investor-member class rights clearly bounded (economic participation, not governance control)
- Annual governance review: what's working, what needs to change
- IRC 704(b) capital accounts fully operational with REA event-sourcing

### Phase 4: Network Governance (2030–2031)

- Inter-cooperative governance questions emerge as model replicates
- Pattern library governance becomes a multi-stakeholder concern
- habitat.eth namespace governance formalized
- RegenHub's governance itself becomes a pattern in the library

### The Productive Tension

Cooperatives are slow. Startups are fast. Techne lives in the tension. Governance must be democratic enough to be legitimate and efficient enough to be viable. The design choice: push decisions to the lowest competent level. Ventures are autonomous. The cooperative governs shared infrastructure. The pattern library is commons. Not everything needs a vote.

## 10. Risk Analysis

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Lease costs exceed revenue in Year 1 | Medium | High | $100K investment provides 12-month runway; aggressive education revenue ramp |
| Crypto market downturn reduces investor/ecosystem interest | Medium | Medium | Revenue model is primarily fiat-denominated; $CLOUD is pegged to USD; crypto exposure is strategic, not existential |
| Venture reciprocity revenue slower than projected | High | Medium | Don't depend on it in Years 1–2; treat it as upside, not baseline |

### Organizational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Key person dependency (Todd) | High | High | Document everything. Build committees. The pattern library is the institutional memory, not any one person |
| Governance disputes as cooperative grows | Medium | Medium | Clear operating agreement, conflict resolution process, regular governance reviews |
| Tension between investor members and patron members | Low | High | Legal structure clearly separates economic rights from governance authority; SporkDAO precedent validates the model |

### Strategic Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Pattern library doesn't compound as theorized | Low | High | This is the core thesis — if it doesn't work, the model needs fundamental rethinking. Mitigate by rigorous documentation and honest assessment at Year 2 |
| Boulder market shifts (remote work reduces coworking demand) | Medium | Medium | Education and venture services don't require physical presence; space is a feature, not the product |
| Replication dilutes rather than strengthens | Low | Medium | Open-source the patterns, not the brand. Each instance is locally governed |

### The Honest Risk

The biggest risk is the one that's hardest to quantify: **that the founding team burns out before the flywheel turns.** Year 1 is heavy. The work is real. The financial margins are tight. The mitigation is community — the reason we're building this cooperatively in the first place. No one should carry this alone.

## 11. Appendix: Pattern Stack as Strategic Framework

### The Seven-Layer Pattern Stack

Every information system — every venture, every organization, every cooperative — decomposes into seven layers:

| Layer | Pattern | Question It Answers |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Identity** | What exists? What are the entities? |
| 2 | **State** | What condition are they in? |
| 3 | **Relationship** | How do they connect? |
| 4 | **Event** | What happened? |
| 5 | **Flow** | How do things move through the system? |
| 6 | **Constraint** | What rules govern behavior? |
| 7 | **View** | How is the system observed and understood? |

REA (Resource-Event-Agent) accounting maps onto layers 1–4: Resources have Identity and State, Agents have Identity and Relationships, Events capture what happened. This is why REA event-sourcing is the natural accounting layer for a cooperative — it's not an arbitrary choice, it's structurally coherent with the pattern stack.

### How the Stack Grounds Strategic Decisions

**Identity (Layer 1):** Who are we? RegenHub, LCA. A cooperative, not a corporation. This isn't branding — it's a structural choice that determines everything downstream. The habitat.eth namespace extends identity into the decentralized web.

**State (Layer 2):** Where are we now? Early stage, funded, building. The $CLOUD credit system tracks state across the internal economy. Patronage capital accounts track member state.

**Relationship (Layer 3):** How do the parts connect? Ventures are autonomous but connected to the cooperative through reciprocity. Members relate to the cooperative through tiers (Community → Co-working → Cooperative). The Ecosystem Dashboard makes relationships visible.

**Event (Layer 4):** What happens? Every transaction, every cohort completion, every patronage distribution is an event. REA event-sourcing means we have a complete, auditable history. Events are facts — they don't change.

**Flow (Layer 5):** How does value move? The flywheel: venture engagement → pattern library refined → next venture scoped faster → surplus recirculated. $CLOUD credits flow through the internal economy. Patronage flows back to members. Education creates membership flow.

**Constraint (Layer 6):** What are the rules? Colorado LCA law. IRC 704(b). The operating agreement. The patronage allocation formula (40/30/20/10). These aren't limitations — they're the structure that makes cooperative economics possible.

**View (Layer 7):** How do we see the system? The Ecosystem Dashboard. Patronage reports. commons.id as knowledge infrastructure. The Economic Habitat Matrix as a diagnostic lens. Views don't change reality — they change what we can perceive, and therefore what we can act on.

### The Craft of Composition

The moat is not the patterns themselves — they're a commons. The moat is **compositional fluency**: the experiential, organizational, compounding ability to see patterns, name them, and compose them into working systems. This is what LearnVibe.Build teaches. This is what venture engagement develops. This is what the cooperative accumulates over time.

Tools shape what organizations can see. What they see determines whether they extract or enrich. The pattern stack is not a product — it's a way of seeing. And seeing clearly is the precondition for building well.
