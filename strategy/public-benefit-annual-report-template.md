# Techne Public Benefit Annual Report Template

*RegenHub, LCA — Colorado Limited Cooperative Association*
*Public Benefit: "Cultivating scenius"*

---

## Purpose

As a public benefit LCA, RegenHub has both a legal obligation and a strategic opportunity with annual reporting. Colorado's LCA statute (§7-58-801) requires that a public benefit cooperative deliver to members an annual benefit report. Doing it well makes the cooperative's impact legible to members, investors, and the broader community.

This template exceeds the statutory minimums — which is the point. The report should be a transparency artifact that makes the cooperative legible, not just a compliance exercise.

## Colorado Legal Requirements

Colorado's LCA statute (§7-58-801) requires that a public benefit LCA deliver to members an annual benefit report that includes:

1. The objectives established to promote the public benefit
2. The standards adopted to measure progress
3. Objective factual information based on those standards
4. An assessment of the cooperative's success in meeting the objectives
5. The name of any third-party standard used

This template satisfies all five requirements while providing substantially more transparency than the statutory minimum.

## Recommended Third-Party Standards

1. **B Impact Assessment** (B Lab) — Most widely recognized, comprehensive, free to take. Recommended as the primary third-party standard for legal compliance.
2. **NCBA CLUSA Cooperative Metrics** — Cooperative-specific, aligns with ICA principles. Valuable supplemental framework.
3. **GRI Standards** (Global Reporting Initiative) — More corporate but thorough. Consider for later years.
4. **H-LAM/T Framework** — Techne's own five-element capability model as an internal measurement framework. Novel, aligned with thesis, supplements external standards with mission-specific metrics.

**Recommendation:** Use B Impact Assessment as the third-party standard (satisfies legal requirement, broadly recognized) and supplement with H-LAM/T five-dimension metrics specific to Techne's mission. This provides both external credibility and internal coherence.
