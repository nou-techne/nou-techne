# Techne Membership Guide

*RegenHub, LCA — A Colorado Limited Cooperative Association*
*DBA: Techne · Public Benefit: "Cultivating scenius"*

---

## 1. Welcome

You found us. Maybe someone brought you to an event. Maybe you wandered up to the third floor of a building on Walnut Street in Boulder and felt something different in the room. However you got here — welcome.

Techne is a cooperative venture studio. We provide infrastructure — space, legal structure, planning, capital access — for autonomous ventures and the people building them. Think of us as soil, not plant. We don't run your project or tell you what to build. We create the conditions where good things grow.

The invisible thing we're cultivating is *scenius* — a word for the collective intelligence that emerges when culturally aligned people share sustained proximity over time. It's not genius (the lone hero). It's what happens in the room, between people, when the conditions are right. That's what this place is for.

## 2. How Techne Works

Techne is structured as a cooperative. That means the people who use it own it and govern it — not outside investors, not a founder with majority shares. The legal entity is **RegenHub, LCA**, a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association filed on February 6, 2026.

Here's the architecture in plain language:

- **RegenHub, LCA** is the legal foundation. Collective ownership, democratic governance. This is the entity that holds everything.
- **Techne Institute** is the operational brand — the physical space on the third floor, the studio, the programming. When you walk in the door, you're at Techne.
- **LearnVibe.Build (LVB)** is our educational program. It's how we build capabilities — in people, teams, and ventures. Cohort 1 completed in February 2026.

The building itself has layers:
- **Second floor:** RegenHub coworking cooperative — desks, meeting rooms, the daily working layer
- **Third floor:** Techne Institute — commons area, teaching space, studio, quiet room, sauna and cold plunge (planned)
- **Roof:** Community gathering space

Colorado's LCA statute gives us a flexible legal container that recognizes multiple forms of contribution — not just capital. Labor counts. Showing up counts. This matters, and it's baked into the structure.

## 3. Membership Tiers

There are three tiers. Each one opens a different level of access, contribution, and governance. Most people start at the first and move deeper over time. There's no pressure to advance — each tier is valuable on its own.

### Community Member — The Open Door

This is how most people enter the ecosystem. No cost, no commitment, no gates.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Access** | Events, communications, community channels, public programming |
| **Contribution** | Participation — showing up, bringing energy, being part of the conversation |
| **Cost** | Free or nominal |
| **Governance** | None (you can attend open meetings, but you don't vote) |

Community membership is about proximity. You're in the orbit. You come to things. You meet people. You see what's happening. For many people, this is exactly the right level of engagement — and it's genuinely valued.

### Co-working Member — Physical Presence

This is the working layer. Founders, freelancers, builders, creators who need a place to work and a community to work alongside.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Access** | Everything in Community, plus: physical space access (desks, meeting rooms, internet, kitchen), operational benefits, member-only events |
| **Contribution** | Monthly dues + participation in community life |
| **Cost** | Monthly membership fee ($200–400/month, market rate for Boulder coworking) |
| **Governance** | Advisory input — you can attend all meetings and share your perspective, but you don't have a formal vote |

Co-working members are the daily heartbeat of the space. You have a key. You show up. You're part of the rhythm of the place — the morning coffee, the hallway conversations, the spontaneous collaborations that happen when people share space.

### Cooperative Member (Patron Member) — Full Ownership

This is the ownership layer. Cooperative members are the legal owners of RegenHub, LCA. You have equity, governance rights, and a stake in the long-term success of everything we build together.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Access** | Everything in Co-working, plus: governance rights, equity stake, patronage dividends, capital account |
| **Contribution** | Demonstrated contribution over a provisional period (6–12 months), followed by board approval |
| **Cost** | Member equity buy-in (amount determined by the Financial Engineering Committee) |
| **Governance** | One member, one vote. Can run for the board. Vote on bylaws and major decisions. |

You don't buy your way into this tier. You earn it through demonstrated alignment and contribution. The provisional period (6–12 months) exists so that both you and the cooperative can verify the fit before making a long-term commitment.

**Patronage formula** — how your contribution is measured:
- 40% labor (time and skill contributed to the cooperative)
- 30% revenue generation (business you bring in or help create)
- 20% cash contributions (financial investment)
- 10% community building (events, culture, connective tissue)

This formula is modeled after SporkDAO's approach — a Colorado LCA precedent that proved cooperatives can recognize multiple forms of value, not just money.

## 4. Investor Members

Investor membership is separate from the three tiers above. It's for people who want to contribute capital and participate economically, but aren't necessarily involved in daily operations.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Capital contribution** | $50,000 minimum (current threshold) |
| **Economic participation** | Capital account + preferred return |
| **Governance** | Limited — protective provisions only |

Here's the important structural point: **investor members cannot outvote patron members on mission-critical decisions.** Patron members always retain at least 51% of voting power. This is by design. The people who do the work and build the culture maintain democratic control. Capital has a voice, but not a veto over mission.

If you're an investor who also wants to be a patron member, you can be both — but you go through the same provisional process as everyone else.

---

## 5. The Membership Journey

Nobody starts as an owner. Here's how the path typically unfolds:

```
Community Participant
        ↓ (engagement, showing up, building relationships)
Co-working Member
        ↓ (deeper involvement, consistent contribution)
Provisional Member (6–12 months)
        ↓ (demonstrated alignment, board approval)
Patron Member (Cooperative Owner)
        ↓ (ongoing patronage)
Capital Account Growth → Distributions
```

**The provisional period** is the most important transition. During those 6–12 months, you're actively contributing and the community is getting to know you at a deeper level. It's not a hazing ritual — it's a mutual trust-building process. At the end, the board reviews your contributions and votes on full membership.

This process exists because cooperatives are long-term commitments. We want people who are genuinely aligned, and we want you to be sure this is the right fit. Rushing that helps no one.

## 6. What's Here

### The Space

- **Commons area** — The living room of Techne. Conversation, collaboration, casual work.
- **Teaching space** — For workshops, cohorts, and presentations.
- **Studio** — Focused creative and technical work.
- **Quiet room** — Deep work, no talking.
- **Coworking (second floor)** — Desks, meeting rooms, kitchen, internet.
- **Sauna and cold plunge** — Planned for the third floor. Recovery, resilience, community ritual.
- **Roof** — Gatherings, events, fresh air with a view of the Flatirons.

### Programs

**LearnVibe.Build (LVB)** — Our educational curriculum, structured in three levels:

- **100-level ($250)** — Foundations. For anyone curious about building in the cooperative ecosystem.
- **200-level ($500)** — Applied. Deeper skill-building, project-based.
- **300-level ($1,000)** — Advanced. For people actively building ventures or leading within the cooperative.

**Morning contemplative practice** — Optional. Meditation, tai chi, journaling. Starts the day with intention. You don't have to come, but it's there.

**Professional team workshops** — Skill-building sessions for teams working within the ecosystem.

**Community events and gatherings** — Regular programming open to all members. Talks, demos, meals, celebrations.

**Venture studio support** — For cooperative members with ventures. Access to the infrastructure, mentorship, and resources of the studio. Ventures commit 1% back to the Hub — a reciprocity agreement that keeps the ecosystem healthy.

## 7. The Economic Model

### How Value Flows

Techne's economics are designed to be transparent and circular. Money comes in, supports the infrastructure, and flows back to members based on their contribution.

**Revenue sources:**
- Co-working membership dues
- Event space rental
- LearnVibe.Build cohort tuition
- Venture reciprocity (1% commitment from ventures back to the Hub)

**Where surplus goes:**
The default is community reinvestment. Surplus "paves the roads" before it goes into anyone's pocket. Infrastructure, programs, and shared resources come first. After that, patronage dividends flow to cooperative members based on the patronage formula (40/30/20/10 described above).

### $CLOUD Credits

$CLOUD is Techne's unit of account. Think of it as the internal currency of the ecosystem.

- **1 CLOUD = 10 USDC** (a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, so 1 CLOUD ≈ $10)
- CLOUD credits are minted against USD deposits into a transparent Mercury bank account — every CLOUD is backed by real money you can verify
- Used for: Techne apps, hiring engineers, running infrastructure, and interacting with the cooperative's economic system

CLOUD maps to four resource primitives: compute, transfer, long-term memory, and short-term memory. These are the building blocks of the digital infrastructure that Techne provides.

You don't need to understand every detail of CLOUD to participate. But if you're curious: it's how we make the cooperative's economics legible and programmable without relying on opaque institutional processes.

### habitat.eth Identity

Every member can receive an ENS subname: **{yourname}.habitat.eth**

This is your identity in the ecosystem — a self-sovereign record on Ethereum that you control. Text records serve as a public social graph. The cooperative governs issuance (who gets a subname), but the records themselves belong to you.

---

## 8. Governance

### The Short Version

Patron members govern the cooperative democratically. One member, one vote. No one gets extra votes for putting in more money.

### The Longer Version

**Who votes:** Cooperative (patron) members only. Each patron member gets exactly one vote, regardless of their capital contribution or seniority.

**What they vote on:**
- Bylaws and amendments
- Board elections
- Major financial decisions
- Mission-critical strategic choices

**The board:** Elected by patron members. Responsible for operational oversight, approving new patron members, and stewarding the cooperative's mission and resources.

**Co-working members** can attend all meetings and provide advisory input. Their perspective matters and is actively sought — they just don't have a formal vote.

**Community members** can attend open meetings. Transparency is a core value; we don't make decisions behind closed doors.

**Investor members** have protective provisions (they can weigh in on decisions that directly affect their capital) but cannot outvote patron members on mission-critical decisions. The 51%+ patron voting threshold is structural, not a gentlemen's agreement.

### Subsidiarity

Decisions are made at the most local level where they have impact. The whole cooperative doesn't vote on what kind of coffee to buy. Teams and working groups have autonomy within their domains. The board handles cooperative-wide governance. Members vote on the big stuff.

## 9. Values & Principles

These aren't aspirational posters on the wall. They're operational commitments that shape how we make decisions.

**Transparency enables coordination. Opacity enables extraction.**
We default to open. Finances, decisions, reasoning — visible to members. When you can see how things work, you can participate meaningfully. When things are hidden, someone is usually benefiting at others' expense.

**Democratic control.**
One member, one vote. The people who build the culture and do the work have the final say. Capital is welcome and valued, but it doesn't buy control.

**Multi-capital recognition.**
Labor counts. Showing up counts. Community building counts. Cash is one form of contribution among several. The patronage formula (40/30/20/10) makes this concrete, not just rhetorical.

**Trust verified, not assumed.**
The provisional period exists because trust is earned through action over time. This protects both the cooperative and incoming members.

**Community reinvestment default.**
Surplus paves the roads before it fills pockets. Shared infrastructure comes first. This is how the ecosystem stays healthy for everyone, not just early participants.

**Sovereignty and care, combined.**
You own your work, your identity, your data. And you take responsibility for the community and the place you're in. These aren't in tension — they're complementary.

**Cosmo-local principle.**
What is light (knowledge, code, ideas) should be global and shared. What is heavy (space, governance, relationships) should be local and self-governed.

**Bioregional citizenship.**
We're in Boulder. We're part of this place. Responsibility and care for where we are — the land, the community, the watershed — is part of what it means to be a member.

These values emerged from Ethereum localism sessions at ETHBoulder and from the lived practice of building this cooperative. They continue to evolve as we do.

## 10. FAQ

**Do I need to be technical to join?**
No. Techne is for builders of all kinds — technical, creative, organizational, educational. The cooperative needs many kinds of contribution.

**Can I just use the coworking space without joining the cooperative?**
Yes. Co-working membership gives you full space access without cooperative ownership. Many people work here for months or years at this level and it's great.

**How long does it take to become a patron member?**
The provisional period is 6–12 months. The exact timeline depends on your level of engagement and contribution. It's not a clock — it's a relationship.

**What's the equity buy-in for cooperative membership?**
The amount is determined by the Financial Engineering Committee and may change over time. Ask us for the current figure.

**Can I be both an investor member and a patron member?**
Yes, but you go through the standard provisional process for patron membership regardless of your capital contribution.

**What happens if I leave?**
Your capital account follows the terms in the operating agreement. Cooperative membership has specific exit provisions — we can walk you through them.

**What's the H-LAM/T framework I keep hearing about?**
It stands for Human, Language, Artifacts, Methodology, Training — a capability model from Doug Engelbart's augmentation research. It's the lens through which we design all our programs and think about human development. In plain terms: we believe in augmenting what people can do, not replacing them.

**Is this like WeWork?**
No. WeWork is a real estate company that rents desks. Techne is a cooperative where members own the infrastructure, govern it democratically, and share in its success. The difference is structural, not just vibes.

**What does "cultivating scenius" actually mean?**
Scenius is the genius of a scene — the creative intelligence that emerges from a community, not from individuals in isolation. We cultivate it by creating the conditions: shared space, aligned values, sustained proximity, and infrastructure that lets people focus on their work. We can't manufacture it. We can make it more likely.

## 11. How to Get Started

**Show up.** Come to an event. Visit the space. Meet people. See if it resonates.

**Become a Community Member.** Join our channels, get on the mailing list, stay connected. This is free and it's where most people start.

**Try a LearnVibe.Build cohort.** The 100-level course ($250) is a great way to go deeper and meet fellow builders.

**Consider co-working.** If you need a place to work and want to be part of the daily community, grab a co-working membership.

**Go deeper.** If you feel the alignment and want to help shape this thing — talk to us about the path to cooperative membership.

**To connect:**
Come find us on the third floor on Walnut Street in Boulder, or reach out through our community channels. We're not hard to find.
