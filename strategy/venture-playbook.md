## 1. What Is Techne?

Techne is a cooperative venture studio. Not an accelerator. Not an incubator. Something different.

Accelerators take equity and run you through a program. Incubators give you a desk and some mentorship. Venture studios build companies in-house. Techne does none of these things.

Techne provides **infrastructure** — space, legal structure, business planning, capital access, a pattern library, a talent pipeline, and a community — for **autonomous ventures**. Your venture is yours. Techne is the soil, not the plant.

The legal entity is RegenHub, LCA — a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association filed February 6, 2026. The cooperative structure is the point. Democratic governance, multi-capital recognition, surplus reinvestment. These aren't ideological ornaments. They're structural choices that change what's possible.

Techne is distributed, not concentrated. Value flows through the network, not up a hierarchy. Ventures don't report to Techne. They grow alongside it, and a small amount of value recirculates back to the commons that enabled them.

**The deal is simple:** Techne gives you infrastructure. You keep your autonomy. You commit 1% back — and you define what that 1% means.

## 2. The Thesis: The Craft of Composition

Every information system — every app, every platform, every protocol — decomposes into the same seven progressive design patterns:

| Layer | Pattern | What It Does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | **Identity** | Who or what exists |
| 2 | **State** | What's true about them now |
| 3 | **Relationship** | How they connect to each other |
| 4 | **Event** | What happened, when, between whom |
| 5 | **Flow** | How value, information, or material moves |
| 6 | **Constraint** | What rules govern the system |
| 7 | **View** | How it's presented to humans |

This isn't an abstraction exercise. It's a practical observation: REA (Resources, Events, Agents) maps cleanly onto layers 1–4. The pattern repeats across domains — accounting systems, knowledge graphs, social platforms, supply chains, governance tools. The substrate is the same. The compositions differ.

**The pattern library is a cooperative commons.** Every venture that builds with Techne refines the library. Every pattern refined makes the next venture faster to scope, cheaper to build, more robust in production.

**The moat is compositional fluency.** Not a proprietary algorithm. Not a data moat. Fluency — experiential, organizational, compounding. The more ventures Techne supports, the deeper the fluency, the faster the next venture ships, the more value recirculates.

This is the flywheel:

```
Venture engagement
  → Pattern library refined
    → Next venture scoped faster
      → Surplus recirculated
        → More ventures attracted
```

It compounds. Slowly at first, then structurally.

## 3. What Techne Provides

### Physical Space

Techne operates from the third floor of a building in Boulder, Colorado — a vertical ecosystem:

- **Third Floor (Techne Institute):** Commons area, teaching space, studio, quiet room. Where teaching, making, and gathering happen.
- **Second Floor (RegenHub Coworking):** Where ventures do their daily work. Desks, meeting rooms, focused workspace.
- **Roof:** Community events, relationship formation, the informal conversations that seed new ventures.

### Legal Infrastructure

- **LCA umbrella:** RegenHub's cooperative structure provides a legal home for ventures that want one.
- **Formation assistance:** Help structuring your entity — LLC, LCA, DAO wrapper, whatever fits.
- **Compliance guidance:** Not legal advice, but informed navigation of Colorado cooperative law.

### Business Planning & Back-Office

- **Business model design:** Not a template — a conversation about what your venture actually needs.
- **Back-office support:** Bookkeeping, invoicing, payroll coordination. The stuff that kills momentum when founders have to do it themselves.
- **Grant writing support:** Especially relevant for public goods and open-source ventures.

### Capital Access

- **Investor network:** Gitcoin / Allo Capital, with Kevin Owocki as lead investor. Access to the Ethereum ecosystem's capital infrastructure.
- **Grant pipelines:** Open Civics, Localism Fund, Gitcoin Grants, ecosystem-specific funding.
- **Revenue model design:** Help thinking through sustainable revenue before you need outside capital.

### Pattern Library

- **Seven-Layer Pattern Stack:** Composable design patterns for information systems (see Section 8).
- **Shared commons:** Every venture that uses the library improves it.
- **Faster scoping:** New ventures benefit from patterns already validated in production.

### Talent Pipeline

- **LearnVibe.Build graduates:** LVB trains people in AI capability development across three curriculum levels. Graduates enter the Techne ecosystem ready to contribute.
- **Community network:** Access to Boulder's tech community and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

### Community & Network

- **ETHBoulder:** Deep ties to the local Ethereum community.
- **Ethereum localism movement:** Part of a broader network building local infrastructure for global protocols.
- **Boulder tech community:** One of the most concentrated startup ecosystems in the country.

### Collective Intelligence

- **Nou:** Techne's collective intelligence agent — perception, connection, grounding. Not a chatbot. An organizational nervous system.

### Infrastructure Credits

- **$CLOUD credits:** Compute, transfer, and memory credits. Infrastructure as a cooperative utility, not a vendor relationship.

### Identity

- **habitat.eth:** ENS subnames for ventures. A shared identity layer that signals ecosystem membership without subordination.

---

## 4. What Ventures Retain

This section is short because the answer is simple: **everything that matters.**

- **Full autonomy** over your product, team, and direction. Techne doesn't approve your roadmap.
- **Your own governance structure.** Run your venture however you want — hierarchy, flat, holacracy, benevolent dictatorship. Your call.
- **Your own fundraising and revenue.** Raise from whoever you want. Keep what you earn. Techne doesn't take a cut of your fundraise.
- **Your own brand and identity.** You're not "a Techne company." You're you.
- **The right to define your 1% reciprocity.** You decide what it looks like (see next section).

Techne does not take equity in your venture. Read that again. No equity. No convertible notes. No token warrants. No side letters.

This is the fundamental structural difference. Traditional studios and accelerators align incentives through ownership. Techne aligns incentives through reciprocity and shared infrastructure. It's a different bet — that cooperative compounding outperforms extractive scaling.

---

## 5. The 1% Reciprocity Commitment

### How It Works

Every venture at Techne commits 1% back to the Hub. But — and this is critical — **the venture defines what that 1% means.**

This isn't a fixed formula. It's a conversation between the venture and the cooperative about what reciprocity looks like for *this particular venture* at *this particular stage.*

### What 1% Could Look Like

- **1% of revenue** — the most straightforward version.
- **1% of tokens** — for ventures with token economics.
- **1% of time** — founders contribute hours back to the commons (mentoring, teaching, community building).
- **Services rendered** — the venture provides its product/service to the cooperative at no cost.
- **Open-source contributions** — code, documentation, patterns contributed to the shared library.
- **Some combination** — most ventures will blend several forms.

### Why It Matters

The 1% commitment isn't about the money. It's about the loop.

Value recirculates: a venture uses Techne's infrastructure to build → the venture's experience refines the pattern library → the refined patterns help the next venture build faster → surplus from reciprocity strengthens the commons → more infrastructure available → more ventures attracted.

This is inspired by models like Gitcoin's approach to public goods funding and revnets (revenue-sharing networks). The principle: **small, consistent flows of value back to the commons create compounding returns for everyone.**

### When It Activates

The reciprocity commitment activates when the venture reaches the Growth phase (see Venture Lifecycle, Section 6). During Discovery, Exploration, Formation, and Building, the focus is on getting the venture to viability. Reciprocity follows success, not precedes it.

### The Tension

Let's be honest: 1% is small. It won't fund the cooperative on its own. That's by design. Techne's revenue architecture doesn't depend on venture reciprocity as a primary income stream (see Section 9). The 1% is a structural commitment to the commons, not a business model.

The tension is real: if a venture becomes wildly successful, 1% of revenue could be significant — and the venture might resent the commitment. If a venture struggles, 1% of nothing is nothing. Techne accepts both outcomes. The commitment is about culture and structure, not extraction.

---

## 6. Venture Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Discovery

**How you find us.** You attend an ETHBoulder event. You take a LearnVibe.Build cohort. You hear about Techne from someone in the community. You walk into the coworking space. You read this document.

Discovery is informal and unstructured. There's no application process at this stage. Show up. Be curious.

### Stage 2: Exploration

**Testing the fit.** You become a Community or Co-working member. You participate in events, workshops, and conversations. You start to understand the culture — cooperative governance, pattern-based thinking, multi-capital recognition.

This is a mutual evaluation period. You're figuring out if Techne's infrastructure and culture serve your venture. Techne's community is figuring out if your venture enriches the ecosystem.

**Duration:** Typically 1–3 months.

### Stage 3: Formation

**Formalizing the venture.** You've decided to build here. Now you access Techne's formation infrastructure:

- Legal structure selection and setup
- Business model design
- Initial pattern library consultation
- habitat.eth subname assignment
- $CLOUD credit allocation

You and Techne agree on what your 1% reciprocity commitment will look like (even though it won't activate until Growth).

**Duration:** 1–2 months.

### Stage 4: Building

**Active development.** Your venture is in build mode. You're using the coworking space, the pattern library, the talent pipeline. You have access to back-office support and business planning assistance.

This is where the pattern library earns its keep. Problems you encounter map to patterns already validated. Solutions you develop refine the library for future ventures.

**Duration:** 3–12 months (varies enormously by venture).

### Stage 5: Growth

**Scaling.** Your venture has product-market fit (or protocol-market fit, or community-market fit). Revenue or traction is real. The 1% reciprocity commitment activates.

You're now contributing back to the commons that supported your formation. Other ventures benefit from your patterns, your experience, your network.

**Duration:** Ongoing.

### Stage 6: Maturity

**Two paths.** Mature ventures either:

1. **Graduate** — the venture has outgrown Techne's infrastructure and moves fully independent. The reciprocity commitment continues (it's a commitment, not a lease).
2. **Anchor** — the venture remains in the ecosystem as a pillar, its founders potentially becoming Patron Members of the cooperative, shaping Techne's direction.

Both paths are healthy. Techne isn't trying to retain ventures forever. It's trying to build an ecosystem where ventures thrive and value recirculates.

---

## 7. Membership Pathway for Founders

Venture founders enter the Techne ecosystem as **Community** or **Co-working Members**. This is intentional — cooperative membership is earned through demonstrated contribution, not purchased at admission.

### The Path

1. **Community Member** — attend events, participate in conversations, explore the space.
2. **Co-working Member** — committed workspace use, deeper community involvement.
3. **Cooperative (Patron) Member** — full governance rights, capital account, patronage dividends.

### Becoming a Patron Member

The transition from Co-working to Patron Member happens through **demonstrated contribution over 6–12 months.** The cooperative evaluates contribution across four dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Examples |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Labor** | 40% | Building, teaching, mentoring, organizing |
| **Revenue Generation** | 30% | Ventures that generate cooperative revenue, client referrals |
| **Cash** | 20% | Direct financial contribution to the cooperative |
| **Community Building** | 10% | Events, introductions, culture-setting, onboarding new members |

### What Patron Members Get

- **Governance rights:** One member, one vote on cooperative decisions.
- **Capital account:** IRC 704(b) compliant. Tracks your contributions and allocations.
- **Patronage dividends:** When the cooperative generates surplus, it's distributed to members based on patronage — not ownership stake.
- **Democratic control:** Patron members control the cooperative's direction. This is real governance, not advisory.

### Why This Matters for Founders

Most startup ecosystems treat founders as customers or portfolio companies. Techne treats founders as potential **co-owners of the infrastructure** that supports them.

This changes the incentive structure fundamentally. You're not trying to get the best deal from Techne. You're building the thing that Techne is. Your success strengthens infrastructure that helps the next founder. Their success strengthens infrastructure that continues to help you.

---

## 8. The Pattern Library: Seven-Layer Pattern Stack

The pattern library is Techne's cooperative commons — a shared resource that every venture contributes to and benefits from.

### The Seven Layers

**Layer 1: Identity**
Who or what exists in the system. Users, organizations, assets, agents. The foundational question: *what are the nouns?*

**Layer 2: State**
What's true about those entities right now. Attributes, properties, status. The snapshot question: *what do we know about them?*

**Layer 3: Relationship**
How entities connect to each other. Ownership, membership, delegation, friendship. The graph question: *who relates to whom, and how?*

**Layer 4: Event**
What happened, when, between whom. Transactions, actions, state changes. The temporal question: *what occurred?*

REA (Resources, Events, Agents) — the foundational accounting ontology — maps cleanly onto layers 1–4. This isn't coincidental. It reflects a deep structural truth: accounting and information systems share a common compositional grammar.

**Layer 5: Flow**
How value, information, or material moves through the system. Pipelines, workflows, value chains. The dynamic question: *how does stuff move?*

**Layer 6: Constraint**
What rules govern the system. Permissions, policies, invariants, business rules. The boundary question: *what's allowed?*

**Layer 7: View**
How the system is presented to humans. Interfaces, dashboards, reports, notifications. The perception question: *what do people see?*

### How Ventures Use It

When a new venture begins scoping its product, the pattern library provides a structured decomposition framework. Instead of starting from a blank canvas, founders map their domain onto the seven layers:

- "Our identity layer handles X."
- "State is tracked via Y."
- "Events flow through Z."

This accelerates architecture decisions, reveals hidden complexity early, and produces systems that compose cleanly with other ventures in the ecosystem.

### How Ventures Improve It

Every venture that builds with the pattern library encounters edge cases, discovers new compositions, and validates (or invalidates) existing patterns. These learnings flow back to the commons:

- New patterns documented
- Existing patterns refined
- Anti-patterns identified
- Domain-specific compositions cataloged

The library is living. It improves with use.

### The Moat

Compositional fluency — the ability to see a new domain and rapidly decompose it into the seven layers — is experiential. You can read about it, but you develop it by doing it, repeatedly, across different domains.

Techne's compounding advantage is organizational fluency: the collective experience of multiple ventures, multiple domains, multiple compositions. This can't be copied by reading documentation. It has to be lived.

---

## 9. Financial Infrastructure

### $CLOUD Credits

$CLOUD is Techne's internal infrastructure currency. It denominates three types of computational resources:

- **Compute** — processing power for builds, AI inference, data processing.
- **Transfer** — bandwidth, API calls, data movement.
- **Memory** — storage, databases, persistent state.

$CLOUD credits are allocated to ventures as part of their Techne membership. They make infrastructure a cooperative utility rather than a vendor relationship. You don't negotiate with AWS. You draw from the commons.

### Patronage Accounting

Techne's accounting system is built on two foundational frameworks:

**REA Ontology (Resources, Events, Agents):** Every economic transaction is modeled as an event involving agents exchanging resources. This maps directly onto layers 1–4 of the pattern stack. It's not a metaphor — it's the same compositional grammar applied to accounting.

**Event Sourcing:** Instead of tracking current balances (state), the system tracks every economic event. Current state is derived from the event stream. This provides full auditability, temporal queries ("what was the balance on March 15?"), and structural transparency.

### Capital Accounts

Every Patron Member has an IRC 704(b) compliant capital account that tracks:

- **Labor contributions** — hours, deliverables, teaching, mentoring
- **Revenue generation** — ventures that generate cooperative revenue
- **Cash contributions** — direct financial investment
- **Community building** — events, introductions, culture work

Contributions are tracked across these multiple capital types, not reduced to a single dollar figure. This is multi-capital recognition in practice: labor and relationships count, not just cash.

### Allocation Cycles

The cooperative runs regular allocation cycles where surplus is distributed to Patron Members based on their patronage formula (40% labor, 30% revenue, 20% cash, 10% community). This is patronage-based distribution — fundamentally different from equity-based distribution.

### Transparency

All members see capital flows. This isn't optional transparency or selective disclosure. It's structural: the accounting system is designed for visibility. Everyone sees how value enters, moves through, and exits the cooperative.

This is a values commitment: **transparency enables coordination; opacity enables extraction.**

### Revenue Architecture

Techne's revenue comes from four streams:

1. **Space revenue** — rent, event hosting, shared resource fees. Predictable, recurring.
2. **Service revenue** — formation assistance, business planning, back-office support. Fee-for-service.
3. **Venture reciprocity** — the 1% commitment from ventures in Growth phase. Variable, growing over time.
4. **Education revenue** — LearnVibe.Build cohorts, workshops, training programs. Cohort-based.

The architecture is deliberately diversified. No single stream dominates. This makes the cooperative resilient to the failure of any individual venture.

---

## 10. Current Ventures

### LearnVibe.Build (LVB)

**What:** An educational program for AI capability development.

**Status:** Cohort 1 complete. Active and enrolling.

**Led by:** Aaron Gabriel and Todd.

**Curriculum:**
- **100-level:** Foundations. Understanding AI tools, prompt engineering, basic integration.
- **200-level:** Application. Building with AI, workflow automation, product development.
- **300-level:** Mastery. Architecture, composition, teaching others.

**Revenue model:** Revenue split with RegenHub — 50/50 initially, decreasing to 20–30% as the venture matures.

**Why it matters to Techne:** LVB is the talent pipeline. Graduates enter the ecosystem with real skills and relationships. Some become venture founders. Some join existing ventures. All strengthen the community.

### commons.id

**What:** A knowledge-graph-backed living archive for convergence events. Think of it as collective memory infrastructure — capturing not just what happened at an event, but the relationships, ideas, and connections that emerged.

**Status:** MVP live.

**Led by:** Todd and Aaron Gabriel.

**Stack:** Supabase + Make.com + Lovable + Claude API.

**Why it matters to Techne:** commons.id is the collective knowledge graph — organizational memory made navigable. It's also a proof of concept for the pattern library: the seven-layer decomposition is visible in the architecture (identities, relationships, events, flows, views).

### Parachute

**What:** Personal extended mind tooling. A progression from simple to comprehensive:
- **Daily** — journaling MVP. Capture thoughts, reflect, build a habit.
- **Brain** — personal knowledge graph. Connect ideas, surface patterns, remember what matters.
- **Computer** — full agentic capability. Your AI works for you, with your context, under your control.

**Status:** In development.

**Led by:** Aaron Gabriel.

**Architecture:** MCP-mediated security model, Docker containers, Agent Security Council. Security is foundational, not bolted on.

**Why it matters to Techne:** Parachute is the personal counterpart to commons.id. If commons.id is collective knowledge graph, Parachute is personal knowledge graph. Together, they represent a complete vision: individuals and communities with augmented memory and cognition, connected but sovereign.

This is the keystone venture — the one that most fully embodies Techne's thesis about composable information systems and individual autonomy within collective infrastructure.

---

## 11. Ecosystem & Network

When you build at Techne, you're joining a network:

### Capital
- **Gitcoin / Allo Capital** — Kevin Owocki as lead investor. Deep ties to public goods funding infrastructure.
- **Open Civics / Localism Fund** — Funding for local-first, community-governed projects.

### Community
- **ETHBoulder** — Boulder's Ethereum community. Events, hackathons, relationships.
- **Ethereum localism movement** — A growing network of place-based Ethereum communities building local infrastructure for global protocols.
- **Boulder tech and startup community** — One of the densest startup ecosystems in the US. University of Colorado, national labs, outdoor culture, and a long tradition of independent thinking.

### Precedent
- **SporkDAO LCA** — A Colorado Limited Cooperative Association that pioneered tokenized patronage in the state. Proof that the LCA structure works for web3-native organizations.

### Philosophy
- **Cosmo-local production** — Share knowledge globally, steward application locally. Techne's pattern library is global commons. Its physical space and community are local.

---

## 12. Values & Principles

These aren't aspirational. They're operational. If we're not practicing them, call it out.

**Transparency enables coordination. Opacity enables extraction.**
Our accounting is visible. Our governance is visible. Our decisions are visible. Not because we're idealists, but because transparency is a coordination technology. When people can see what's happening, they can coordinate. When they can't, someone is usually extracting.

**Democratic control.**
Patron Members control governance. One member, one vote. Not weighted by capital contribution. Not delegated to a board that meets quarterly. Real, ongoing, democratic control over the cooperative's direction.

**Multi-capital recognition.**
Labor counts. Knowledge counts. Relationships count. Not just cash. The patronage formula (40/30/20/10) is a structural commitment to valuing what actually makes the cooperative work.

**Autonomy preserved.**
Ventures are autonomous. Not subsidiaries. Not portfolio companies. Not "our companies." Autonomous ventures that choose to build alongside shared infrastructure. The distinction matters.

**Community reinvestment.**
Surplus strengthens the commons before individual payouts. The cooperative exists to serve its members, and the best way to serve members is to maintain and improve the infrastructure they depend on.

**Cosmo-local.**
Share knowledge globally, steward application locally. The pattern library is open. The community is rooted in Boulder. Both are essential.

### The Economic Habitat Matrix

Techne operates with awareness of a framework we call the Economic Habitat Matrix: 49 organizational archetypes mapped across two axes — governance orientation and systemic relationship.

The key insight: **tools shape what organizations can see, and what they see determines whether they extract or enrich.** Most accounting software, most business tools, most organizational infrastructure is designed for competitive and extractive zones. It literally can't see cooperative value creation.

Techne's tools — patronage accounting, $CLOUD credits, the pattern library, multi-capital tracking — are designed for the Contributive and Mutualistic zones. They make cooperative value creation visible, measurable, and governable.

This isn't about being anti-business. It's about expanding the organizational vocabulary beyond extraction.

---

## 13. How to Start a Venture at Techne

### Step 1: Show Up

Come to an event. Take a LearnVibe.Build cohort. Visit the coworking space. Talk to people. There's no application form for showing up.

### Step 2: Become a Member

Start as a Community or Co-working member. Use the space. Participate in the culture. Get to know the people and the patterns.

### Step 3: Have the Conversation

When you have a venture idea (or an existing venture you want to bring into the ecosystem), talk to existing members. Not a pitch meeting — a conversation. Does this venture fit the ecosystem? Does the ecosystem serve this venture? Is there mutual benefit?

### Step 4: Formalize

If the fit is right:
- Structure your entity (with Techne's formation assistance)
- Map your domain onto the pattern library
- Agree on your 1% reciprocity commitment
- Get your habitat.eth subname
- Set up your $CLOUD allocation

### Step 5: Build

Use the infrastructure. Refine the patterns. Ship your product. Grow your venture.

### Step 6: Reciprocate

When you reach the Growth phase, your 1% commitment activates. Value recirculates. The commons strengthens. The next venture benefits.

### Step 7: Deepen (Optional)

Over 6–12 months of demonstrated contribution, consider becoming a Patron Member. Gain governance rights. Shape the cooperative's direction. Own the infrastructure that supports you.

## 14. FAQ

**How is this different from Y Combinator / Techstars / [insert accelerator]?**

Those programs take 7–10% equity in exchange for capital, mentorship, and network access over a fixed program period. Techne takes no equity. There's no fixed program. The infrastructure is ongoing, and the reciprocity commitment is defined by the venture, not by Techne. It's a fundamentally different model — cooperative, not extractive.

**How is this different from a traditional venture studio?**

Venture studios typically build companies in-house with studio employees, retaining majority ownership. Techne doesn't build your company. You build your company. Techne provides infrastructure. You retain full autonomy and ownership.

**What if my venture fails?**

Then it fails. Techne doesn't own equity, so there's no write-down. Your reciprocity commitment (which activates at the Growth phase) never triggered. You learned things. The patterns you explored might help the next venture. The community remains. Failure is normal and expected.

**What if my venture succeeds wildly?**

Then 1% of whatever you defined goes back to the commons. If that's 1% of significant revenue, it's a significant contribution. That's the deal. It's designed to scale with success without becoming punitive.

**Can I leave?**

Yes. Ventures are autonomous. If Techne stops serving your needs, you leave. Your venture is yours. The reciprocity commitment is a cooperative commitment, not a legal cage — though the specific terms will be part of your membership agreement.

**Do I have to use the pattern library?**

No. It's a resource, not a requirement. But ventures that use it tend to build faster and produce more composable systems. And they contribute improvements back, which helps everyone.

**Do I have to be in Boulder?**

Physical presence is valuable — the coworking space, the events, the informal conversations. But ventures can be distributed. The pattern library, $CLOUD credits, and community network work remotely. Being in Boulder helps; it's not mandatory.

**What's the catch?**

The catch is that cooperatives are hard. Democratic governance is slower than autocratic governance. Multi-capital accounting is more complex than simple equity splits. Transparency means everyone sees the messy parts. Reciprocity means you're committing to something beyond your own venture.

If you want the fastest possible path to a Series A, Techne is probably not for you. If you want to build something durable, within infrastructure that compounds, alongside people who are playing a longer game — then maybe it is.

**How do I learn more?**

Show up. The third floor in Boulder is open. Events are posted through the community. LearnVibe.Build cohorts run regularly. Or just reach out to someone in the ecosystem.

*Techne: the ancient Greek concept of craft, art, and skill — the knowledge of how to make things well. Not just what to build, but how to build it. The craft of composition.*
