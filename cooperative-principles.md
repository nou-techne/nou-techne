# The Seven Cooperative Principles, Techne Edition

The ICA principles are universal scaffolding — every cooperative adopts them, but the best ones make them theirs. Here's how Techne's specific thesis, structure, and culture flavor each one.

## 1. Voluntary & Open Membership

**Standard:** Open to all who can use services and accept responsibilities.

**Techne flavor:** Three-tier membership is the mechanism. Community tier has no gatekeeping — show up, participate, you're in. But Cooperative membership (full governance, equity) requires demonstrated patronage. The door is open; the path is earned. This isn't exclusion — it's the difference between a park (open) and a garden (tended). The membership journey itself is a form of training.

**Distinct commitment:** We don't select for credentials. We select for contribution. A high school student who shows up every Wednesday and documents patterns has a clearer path to cooperative membership than an investor who writes a check and disappears.

## 2. Democratic Member Control

**Standard:** One member, one vote. Members control policy and decisions.

**Techne flavor:** Colorado LCA allows weighted voting — we choose not to use it for patron members. But we go further: democratic control extends to the tools themselves. The patronage accounting system isn't a black box administered by a treasurer — it's transparent infrastructure that any member can audit. The pattern library is collectively governed. commons.id is a shared knowledge graph, not a proprietary database.

**Distinct commitment:** Transparency enables coordination. Opacity enables extraction. We build the tools that make democratic control practicable, not just legal. You can't govern what you can't see.

**The Nathan Schneider warning:** We actively resist implicit feudalism — the tendency for platform founders to retain de facto control even in nominally democratic structures. The governance arc from founding stewards to full cooperative democracy is documented, time-bound, and enforceable.

## 3. Member Economic Participation

**Standard:** Members contribute equitably to capital. Surplus allocated by patronage.

**Techne flavor:** This is where Techne gets distinctive. Patronage isn't just tracked — it's composed. The four-factor formula (40% labor / 30% revenue / 20% cash / 10% community) makes visible what most organizations hide: the relative weight of different forms of contribution.

$CLOUD credits make economic participation continuous rather than annual. You don't wait for a year-end distribution to see your contribution reflected — the economic system is alive, flowing, legible in real time through Superfluid streams.

**Distinct commitment:** Capital accounts follow IRC 704(b) — not because we have to (we're an LCA, not a partnership), but because we believe the most rigorous accounting standard produces the most trustworthy cooperation. Investor members receive limited preferred returns, never governance control. Capital serves labor, not the reverse.

## 4. Autonomy & Independence

**Standard:** Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by members.

**Techne flavor:** The venture studio model is autonomy architecture. Each venture (commons.id, LearnVibe.Build, Parachute) operates independently. Techne provides soil — infrastructure, legal wrapper, shared resources — but doesn't own or control what grows in it. The 1% reciprocity commitment is voluntary, defined by ventures themselves, and flows back to the commons.

**Distinct commitment:** We take outside investment (Kevin, Jeremy) through the investor member class, but the LCA structure guarantees that investor capital never translates to governance control. This is the explicit structural answer to the autonomy question: yes, we accept capital; no, capital doesn't buy votes.

## 5. Education, Training & Information

**Standard:** Cooperatives provide education and training for members and the public.

**Techne flavor:** LearnVibe.Build is the dedicated education engine — not a side program, but a first-class venture within the studio. The pattern library itself is educational infrastructure: each pattern documents not just *what* to build but *why* the pattern exists and *when* to apply it. The seven-layer progressive design pattern stack is a curriculum disguised as architecture.

**Distinct commitment:** We publish our tools, our patterns, and our governance documents openly. The Habitat site, the journal, the thesis — these aren't marketing. They're the education principle in practice. Knowledge that stays inside the cooperative isn't cooperative knowledge.

## 6. Cooperation Among Cooperatives

**Standard:** Cooperatives serve members most effectively by working together through local, national, regional, and international structures.

**Techne flavor:** The venture studio model *is* cooperation among cooperatives at the smallest viable scale. Each venture is a semi-autonomous entity that shares infrastructure, knowledge, and economic flow with the others through Techne. commons.id extends this further — a shared knowledge graph that any convergence, any cooperative, any commons-oriented organization can use.

**Distinct commitment:** The 1% reciprocity flow and the $CLOUD credit system are designed to be interoperable across issuers. The grammar is shared; the implementation is local. Any cooperative that adopts the same patterns can participate in the same economic watershed. This is cooperation among cooperatives as protocol, not just principle.

## 7. Concern for Community

**Standard:** Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities.

**Techne flavor:** Grounded in place — Boulder, Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, where the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains. The Neighborhood Village Project connects the cooperative to its physical community. The solar audit cycle ties economic activity to ecological rhythm. Nighttime patronage flows to pool.habitat.eth, a grant endowment for community benefit — the cooperative literally generates commons wealth while it sleeps.

**Distinct commitment:** The Economic Habitat Matrix maps the relationship between organizational governance and ecological impact. Techne exists in the Mutualistic zone — contributive relationship, dispersive governance. This isn't aspiration; it's architectural. The tools we build, the accounting we practice, the patterns we publish — all designed to make the contributive zone operable for others, not just for us.
