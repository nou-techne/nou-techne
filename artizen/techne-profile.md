## 2. Questions

### What are you making? (250 char limit — 192 chars)

> A technology learning center and Ethereum hub in downtown Boulder. People learn to build together here — software, cooperatives, local economies — with shared desks, tools, and weekly mentors.

### How will your project impact the world? (250 char limit — 181 chars)

> Boulder has talent but no commons-owned space for builders. Techne makes Ethereum infrastructure, civic tech, and cooperative economics skills you can practice, not just read about.

### What progress have you made? (250 char limit — 188 chars)

> RegenHub has run co-working and events on the second floor for two years. We incorporated as a Colorado cooperative in 2026 and built commons.id. Now expanding upstairs to triple capacity.

### Why are you the right person? (250 char limit — 184 chars)

> Todd Youngblood spent two years growing RegenHub into Boulder's regenerative tech hub. A data engineer and co-op organizer, he bridges Ethereum's global vision with local commitment.

## 3. Artifact

**Guidance for the visual:**
The Artifact should capture the *vibe* of Techne — not marketing, not a logo. Ideas:

- **A photograph of the studio space** as it exists now — raw potential, windows, the view of the Flatirons
- **The view from the studio** — where the Great Plains meet the Rockies at 5,430 feet
- **The building exterior** at golden hour — the physical place where this happens

Must be square, JPG/PNG/GIF, max 10MB. No text, no logos, no overlays.

## 5. Qualification — Terminus Fund for Network States (1691/2000 chars)

> Techne at RegenHub qualifies across every eligibility requirement. We are an operating cooperative in Boulder, Colorado, building physical and digital infrastructure for a new kind of institution.
>
> Network State Aligned: Techne formed through Ethereum community coordination and is becoming a permanent physical institution — a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association with decentralized governance. Our digital layer includes commons.id (live knowledge graph) and habitat.eth (ENS identity namespace).
>
> Community as the Unit: A defined community of builders sharing values in cooperative economics, Ethereum Localism, and collective intelligence. Members hold governance rights. Revenue flows to community grants.
>
> Experimental by Design: ETHBoulder is our recurring convergence — live experimentation in governance and coordination, captured by commons.id in real time. AI building cohorts develop capability through Engelbart's augmentation framework.
>
> Material and Enabling: Raising funds for the studio — physical learning center and Ethereum hub, alongside enabling tools: commons.id, the e/H-LAM/T/S framework, cooperative patronage accounting.
>
> Constructive Exit: A peaceful, opt-in alternative to extractive tech education. Commons-owned infrastructure where value is distributed, not extracted.
>
> Execution-Oriented: Two years operating RegenHub. LCA incorporated Feb 2026. commons.id live at ETHBoulder. Active community, investors including Kevin Owocki (Gitcoin/Allo Capital).
>
> Shareable Learnings: Open source under Peer Production License. Public knowledge graph, published frameworks at the-habitat.org and github.com/nou-techne. Built to be forked.
