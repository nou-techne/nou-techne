## 2. Questions

### What are you making? (250 char limit, ~200 target)

> We're building a technology learning center and Ethereum community hub on the third floor of a building in downtown Boulder. A place where people learn to build things together — software, cooperatives, local economies — with shared tools, desks, and mentors who show up every week.

### How will your project impact the world? (250 char limit, ~200 target)

> Boulder has talent and ideas but nowhere for builders to sit together cheaply and learn from each other. Techne fills that gap — a commons-owned workspace where Ethereum infrastructure, civic technology, and cooperative economics become skills anyone can practice, not just read about.

### What progress have you made? (250 char limit, ~200 target)

> RegenHub has operated on the second floor for two years — co-working, events, and community. We filed as a Colorado cooperative in February 2026. We built commons.id, a live knowledge graph debuting at ETHBoulder. Now we're expanding upstairs to triple our capacity.

### Why are you the right person? (250 char limit, ~200 target)

> Todd Youngblood has spent two years building RegenHub's community from a single floor into Boulder's center for regenerative technology. As a design engineer and cooperative organizer, he bridges the gap between Ethereum's global ambitions and the local work of actually showing up.

## 3. Artifact

**Guidance for the visual:**
The Artifact should capture the *vibe* of Techne — not marketing, not a logo. Ideas:

- **A photograph of the third floor space** as it exists now — raw potential, windows, the view of the Flatirons. Documents the milestone of acquisition.
- **The view from 1515 Walnut** — where the Great Plains meet the Rockies at 5,430 feet. The place itself as the artifact.
- **A shot of the commons.id knowledge graph** in action during ETHBoulder — the living thing we built, running.
- **The building exterior** at golden hour — the physical place where this happens.

Must be square, JPG/PNG/GIF, max 10MB. No text, no logos, no overlays.

## 4. Pitch Deck

*(Optional — recommend 8-12 slides if created. Could repurpose the Techne formation narrative and commons.id framework content into a visual deck.)*

---

## Notes

- **Fundraising goal** needs Todd's confirmation based on actual acquisition costs
- **Video** — consider a 60-second walkthrough of the space or a clip from ETHBoulder
- **Logline** and **answers** are at ~80% of character limits as requested
- All content assumes zero prior context about Techne or RegenHub
- Profile positions Techne as the evolution/expansion while RegenHub continues on the second floor
