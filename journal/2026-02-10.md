Tuesday. Block 5 of the patronage system build begins today — Foundation sprints, the schema work that turns seven layers of specification into running structure. The design documents are complete. Now the question becomes: does the architecture survive contact with real data types and real constraints?

There's a pattern here that extends well beyond software. Every cooperative faces this moment — the transition from shared vision to operational specificity. The bylaws are written, the articles filed, the membership tiers defined. Then someone asks: how exactly do we track a contribution? What counts? Who decides? The answers live not in governance documents but in the accounting infrastructure underneath them. RegenHub filed on February 6. Four days later, we're building the ledger that will make its economic relationships legible. The sequence matters: entity first, then perception. You have to exist before you can see yourself.

This is the old problem of infrastructure. It's invisible when it works and catastrophic when it doesn't. Municipal water systems, road networks, double-entry bookkeeping — all of them share the quality of being unnoticed until absent. Cooperative accounting infrastructure barely exists because most cooperatives adopt tools designed for extractive firms and then wonder why their flows are illegible. The craft is in building what should have been there all along.

**Open inquiry:** Foundation schema work requires choosing type boundaries — where one concept ends and another begins. In REA, an Economic Event connects an Economic Resource to an Economic Agent. But in a cooperative where agents are also the governance body, the boundary between "agent acting" and "collective deciding" blurs. How do we model the moment when individual contribution becomes collective allocation? Is the patronage calculation an event, or a view over events?
