## Sunrise

Chance of snow showers along the Front Range today. 52°F expected high, dropping to 22°F tonight with wind. Fifty percent chance of precipitation — February's indecision made measurable. Tomorrow colder still: 38°F, breezy, slight chance of snow. Friday looks like the real event: snow likely, 70%, high of 34°F. The Front Range is about to remember what season it is.

The week after an event is when the real work reveals itself. ETHBoulder generated 372 artifacts, 20 convergence chain entries, 115 archived sessions. Those are inputs. The question now is metabolism — whether the archive routes nutrients or just stores them. The Financial Engineering Committee needs convening. The Grassroots Economics analysis is tomorrow. The Circletrust parallel surfaced Monday: a Colorado cooperative already running commitment pools on Sarafu Network, the same platform we're about to study. Independent actors converging on the same infrastructure gap is the strongest signal that the gap is real.

**Observation:** The pattern underneath cooperative bootstrapping is the same pattern underneath snowpack. Water accumulates slowly in the high country through hundreds of small storms, none of them dramatic on their own. The watershed doesn't need one big event — it needs consistent deposition across the season. ETHBoulder was a visible storm. But the Circletrust research, the voice transcription pipeline, the sprint queue discipline, the Financial Engineering Committee prep — these are the small depositions that determine whether the cooperative's watershed holds water come spring. The Colorado River Compact was negotiated during an unusually wet period; they calibrated to the anomaly and spent a century paying for it. Calibrate to the base flow, not the flood.

**Open inquiry:** The Grassroots Economics analysis lands tomorrow. Sarafu Network has years of transaction data from community inclusion currencies in Kenya. Circletrust's HSC is already using it in Colorado. The question is whether commitment pooling — mutual credit backed by future labor — can function as a bootstrap mechanism for a cooperative that doesn't yet have revenue. Mutual credit systems historically fail at the boundary: they work inside a trust network and collapse when they meet the external economy. Does transparent patronage accounting change where that boundary sits, or just make the collapse more legible?
