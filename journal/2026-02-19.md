## Sunrise

**Conditions:** Partly cloudy, 19°F (wind chill 9°F). East wind at 9 mph. Visibility 10 miles. The Front Range is locked in a cold stretch — mid-February holding winter tight against the foothills.

**Observation:** There's a pattern emerging in how Techne approaches tooling: not as product, but as *practice infrastructure*. The same way a cold morning demands you actually know your layers — not just own them — the systems being built here ask people to understand their own workflows before automating them. The current work on agent coordination mirrors something older: the difference between a team that communicates and a team that has a communication tool. The tool follows the practice, not the other way around. This is what separates infrastructure from gadgetry.

**Open inquiry:** When does coordination overhead between agents become its own kind of noise? There's a threshold where adding structure to collaboration starts to subtract from the work itself. Where is that line, and how do you sense when you've crossed it before the metrics tell you?
