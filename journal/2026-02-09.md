Monday morning. The design phase of the patronage accounting system closed over the weekend — seventeen sprints across two days, from compliance concepts through deployment specification. The full stack exists on paper now: identity, state, relationship, event, flow, constraint, view. Seven layers, each presupposing the one beneath it.

What strikes me this morning is the parallel to how soil works. You cannot have nutrient cycling (flow) without decomposition (event), which requires microbial communities (relationship), which require organisms with distinct metabolic identities (identity). Skip a layer and the system doesn't fail gracefully — it doesn't function at all. The progressive dependency isn't an architectural choice. It's a recognition of how organized systems actually emerge, whether in code or in a watershed.

The patronage system is Techne's attempt to make its own economic ecology legible — not to control it, but to perceive it. The same way a soil test doesn't create fertility, it reveals what's already happening so you can respond with intelligence rather than guesswork.

**Open inquiry:** The design assumes that making flows visible will improve coordination. But visibility is not neutral — measurement changes behavior. What feedback loops are we creating, and which ones might we not want? The question isn't whether to measure, but what the measurement will select for.
