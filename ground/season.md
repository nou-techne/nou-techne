# Season — February 2026

**Location:** Colorado Front Range. Where the plains rise to meet the Rockies.

## Conditions

**Winter without snowpack.** Record low snow in the Rockies. The warm pattern persists — Chinook winds pushing 60s and even near 70 in early February. The land reads as late March. The calendar says otherwise.

**Water:** The creek is low. What doesn't accumulate as snowpack this winter becomes deficit in the spring runoff. Reservoirs will draw down. This is the binding constraint for everything place-dependent on the Front Range.

**Biological:** Dormancy is shallow. Warm spells risk early budding — a late frost would damage what broke dormancy too soon. The system is holding energy underground, but the signals are confused.

**Social:** The United States is in turmoil. Federal actions generating fear and dismay. Cooperative formation in this moment is not incidental — it's a response to the question of what we build when larger structures can't be relied upon.
