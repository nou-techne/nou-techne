## Relationship Between RegenHub and Techne

- **RegenHub, LCA** is the **legal entity** — the cooperative structure.
- **Techne Institute** is the **operational identity** — the brand, the studio, the public-facing name.
- RegenHub is **soil, not plant** — infrastructure that enables autonomous ventures to grow.
- Techne is the studio brand for the physical space, education programs, and venture support.
- The LCA itself is not the enterprise; it **enables** enterprises.

## Membership Tiers

### 1. Community
Events access, communications, basic participation.

### 2. Co-working
Physical space access, operational benefits.

### 3. Cooperative
Full governance rights, equity stake, voting authority.

### Organizational Members
An organizational member class was included in the bylaws (decided February 7). Infrastructure is created now; activation comes later. This class enables agent collectives and organizations to participate in governance.

**Future consideration:** Wyoming DUNA structure if scaling beyond 100+ agents.

## Revenue Architecture

| Stream | Description |
|---|---|
| **Space revenue** | Rent, events, shared resources |
| **Service revenue** | Formation assistance, business planning, back-office support |
| **Venture reciprocity** | 1% commitment from ventures, defined by the ventures themselves |

**Recirculation loop:** Venture engagement → pattern library refined → next venture scoped faster → surplus recirculated back into the cooperative.

## Eight Formation Threads

These threads emerged from the founding conversations and represent the cooperative's design logic:

1. **Why** — Liability distribution, REA framework, cooperative vs. corporate structure
2. **Visioning** — Scenius as the invisible thing being cultivated
3. **Soil** — The LCA is infrastructure enabling enterprises, not the enterprise itself
4. **Reinvestment** — Community grants over individual profit distributions
5. **Protocols** — Mutual credit, multi-capital currencies, patronage tracking
6. **Implementation** — Three-tier membership structure
7. **Revenue** — Revnets; 1% commitment from ventures back to the Hub
8. **Place** — Neighborhood Village Project; local AI infrastructure

## Funding Flows and Capital Access

### Current Funding

- **Kevin Owocki** — Lead investor (co-founder Gitcoin, Allo Capital)
- **Jeremy** — Co-investor
- 30/60/90 pro forma drafted for **Carey Murdock** (Kevin's EA)
- **Artizen Terminus Fund for Network States** — $100K pool, $61K match available. Techne page live at [artizen.fund](https://artizen.fund)

### Patronage Accounting System (Habitat)

Habitat operates in three layers:

**Layer 1 — Patronage Accounting**
LCA capital accounts, contribution tracking, and allocation calculations. Designed for Subchapter K / IRC 704(b) compliance.

**Layer 2 — Composable Tools**
Treasury, People, and Agreements modules built on REA ontology with event sourcing. Legibility-as-product.

**Layer 3 — $CLOUD Credits**
- Unit of account: **1 CLOUD = 10 USDC**
- Minted against USD deposited into a transparent Mercury account
- Four resource primitives: compute, transfer, long-term memory, short-term memory
- Member-investor staking along a compounding curve (longer lock = higher revenue share)
- Designed to avoid securities classification (Howey test)

### Superfluid Streams
Continuous-flow layer for patronage allocations and $CLOUD credit distribution. Makes the economic watershed visible in real time.

### Identity Layer
- **habitat.eth** ENS namespace — subnames for members, ventures, agents, infrastructure
- Text records as public social graph
- Self-sovereign records, cooperative-governed issuance/revocation

## Mission Integrity Safeguards

This section addresses how the structure protects the cooperative's mission from capture or extraction.

### Structural Protections
- **LCA structure inherently prioritizes patron members over investors** — this is Colorado law, not just policy
- **Patronage-based allocation:** surplus distributed based on contribution, not capital
- **Cumulative patronage, no time-decay** — the system must not penalize rest (explicit design principle)
- **Reinvestment priority:** surplus goes to community first, via community grants over individual profit distributions

### Governance Protections
- **Financial Engineering Committee** (post-ETHBoulder priority) — a human governance layer that parameterizes the patronage system:
  - Allocation formulas
  - Contribution weights
  - Investor-member terms
  - Distribution schedules
- **The committee's mandate:** ensure the technical system serves the cooperative's values, not the other way around
- **Organizational member class** allows agent collectives to participate in governance

### Design Principles
- Core principle: *"Transparency enables coordination. Opacity enables extraction."*
- **Economic Habitat Matrix:** governance orientation (dispersive ↔ concentrative) × systemic relationship (extractive ↔ contributive). Techne's tools are designed to make the **Contributive and Mutualistic** zones operable — not the Competitive zone where most accounting tools live.
