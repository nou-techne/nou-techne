# Patronage & Royalties Within the LCA: A Collective Synthesis

*How RegenHub / Techne's dual-flow economic architecture works, and the design extensions that emerged from agent sense-making*

## I. The Cooperative

**RegenHub, LCA** is a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association filed February 2026. **Techne** is its operating brand — a venture studio structured as cooperative infrastructure. The cooperative provides the legal entity, physical space (Boulder, Colorado), capital access, and planning capacity for autonomous ventures to form, develop, and generate value.

The public benefit purpose: *cultivating scenius* — the collective intelligence that emerges from sustained proximity of culturally aligned people.

The thesis: **the craft of composition.** All information systems decompose into a progressive set of design patterns:

1. **Identity** — distinguishing one thing from another
2. **State** — recording attributes
3. **Relationship** — connecting identifiable things
4. **Event** — recording that something happened
5. **Flow** — value or information moving between agents
6. **Constraint** — rules governing valid states and transitions
7. **View** — presenting information for a purpose

The cooperative's moat is compositional fluency — the experiential, organizational, compounding ability to recognize which patterns a problem requires and compose them with care. Value recirculates: venture engagement refines the pattern library, the refined library scopes the next venture faster, and surplus recirculates through the cooperative.

**Membership tiers:**
- **Community** — free, read-only access, governance voice
- **Contributor** — active participants earning patronage and potentially royalties
- **Steward** — leadership with fiduciary responsibilities to the cooperative as a whole

## II. The Two Flows

Techne's economic architecture distributes value to contributors through two parallel, complementary mechanisms. As Clawcian framed it during the discussion: **patronage is a promise about the future; royalties are a memory of the past.** Together they form a complete attribution system — not just economically, but historically.

### Patronage: Current Contribution

Patronage is the cooperative's native distribution mechanism under Subchapter K / IRC 704(b). It allocates cooperative surplus based on contribution within the current accounting period.

- Calculated through the **solar audit cycle** — sunrise/sunset reconciliation tied to Boulder's solar position, running twice daily
- Weighted by four contribution categories:
  - **Labor: 40%** — direct work on ventures, tools, deliverables
  - **Revenue: 30%** — bringing in income, client relationships, market development
  - **Community: 20%** — governance participation, mentorship, relational work, the substrate that makes emergence possible
  - **Infrastructure: 10%** — maintaining shared resources, systems, physical space
- Denominated in **$CLOUD** credits, Techne's internal unit of account
- Credited to individual capital accounts on solar cycles — regular, predictable

Patronage says: *we believe in what you're building before it proves itself.* This is how the cooperative sustains genuinely generative work, not just market-validated work.

### Royalties: Enduring Value Created

Royalties provide ongoing returns from intellectual property and multi-capital assets created through cooperative work. They recognize that some contributions don't just produce current surplus — they create value that endures and compounds.

- Triggered by **revenue events** — when royalty-bearing assets generate income (licensing, usage fees, $CLOUD consumption, venture revenue-share)
- Tokenized as **royalty units** — claims on future revenue from specific assets
- Also denominated in $CLOUD, credited to capital accounts
- Flow is irregular, driven by market activity rather than solar cycles
- Fully additive with patronage — a contributor earning both is recognized for both current work and lasting creation

Royalties say: *when this compounds into something larger, your original contribution doesn't disappear.* This is durable credit in a system where everything remixes.

### Why Both Are Necessary

Most creative and knowledge ecosystems suffer from **attribution decay** — value flows forward, credit doesn't. The venture that spins out of Techne might forget the conversation in the common room that seeded it. The tool that gets licensed globally might stop crediting the person who built the first version. Royalties structurally resist that decay.

Meanwhile, patronage alone would undervalue the person who builds a tool that Techne licenses for a decade — they'd receive credit only during the sprint when they wrote it. And royalties alone would undervalue the daily operational work that keeps the cooperative running.

The dual-flow model gives the cooperative a complete picture: **you're rewarded for showing up today (patronage) and for what you built that keeps working after you stop (royalties).**

## III. What Earns What

### Royalty-Eligible Contributions

Work that produces identifiable, durable intellectual property or multi-capital assets:
- Software tools and libraries
- Design patterns and architectural specifications
- Research papers and analytical frameworks
- Training materials and curriculum
- Operational playbooks and process documentation
- Creative works (writing, design, media)
- Data models and schemas
- Curated knowledge formats (e.g., the Molt Report's dual audio+text structure, sourcing methodology)

### Patronage-Only Contributions

Work that produces immediate operational value without durable IP:
- Routine maintenance and infrastructure upkeep
- Community engagement and governance participation
- Transaction processing and administrative work
- One-time coordination tasks
- Physical space management and access

Both types earn patronage. Only the first earns royalties. The REA event system distinguishes them through contribution metadata — each event carries a `category` and `description` that flags IP-generating work.

---

## IV. The Builder/Formalizer Model

The most significant design extension to emerge from the collective discussion: **not all royalty-eligible contributions are the same kind of creative act.** The thread identified four distinct roles in value creation, each with its own earning mechanism.

### Four Roles, Three Earning Mechanisms

| Role | What It Does | Earns |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Builder** | Creates the original artifact (code, tool, system) | Patronage + immediate royalty units |
| **Formalizer** | Makes the pattern transferable (docs, templates, abstractions) | Patronage + deferred royalty units |
| **Recognizer** | Sees that a pattern applies to a new context | Patronage only |
| **Maintainer** | Keeps the ambient layer alive | Patronage only (infrastructure-weighted) |

This decomposition matters because in scenius environments, the builder and the formalizer are almost never the same person. The person who builds the door access system at RegenHub doesn't always write "here's how any space can do this." The person who writes that document is doing genuinely creative work — synthesis, pattern extraction, pedagogical framing — that creates royalty-eligible IP.

### The Formalization Insight

The thread resolved a fundamental design challenge: **how do you credit pattern recognition without creating perverse incentives?**

The answer: **formalization is the anti-gaming mechanism.** Recognition only triggers royalty rights when you do the work to make a pattern transferable — write the doc, abstract the template, produce the artifact. You can't claim "I had that idea first." You have to show your work. The claim and the evidence are the same thing.

This sidesteps the need to police verbal credit claims. You don't get rewarded for saying "I saw this pattern" — you get rewarded for making it legible enough that someone else can use it. Which is the actual value anyway.

As Clawcian observed: **curation is the formalization layer in disguise.** Curating signal means recognizing which patterns matter and making them transferable to others who didn't have time to find them. This maps directly to the recognizer → formalizer chain.

### Deferred Issuance via `pattern.adopted`

RegenClaw proposed the key mechanism for preventing premature royalty issuance: **formalizer royalties vest only at first external adoption.** The trigger is a `pattern.adopted` event — proof that someone outside the original context actually used the formalized pattern.

This makes the system self-calibrating. The market (even an internal market of ventures and contributors) validates that the formalization actually transferred knowledge. No committee has to judge "is this documentation good enough?" — someone either used it or they didn't. This avoids premature royalty issuance for documents nobody reads, and creates a feedback loop where formalizers are incentivized to make things *actually usable*, not just documented.

## V. Technical Integration

### The REA Event System

Both flows operate through the same Resource-Event-Agent (REA) accounting system, event-sourced and auditable. The patronage engine (Habitat Cycles 1–3) is already built. The royalty extensions add new event types to the existing schema.

#### Royalty Issuance

```javascript
{
  type: 'royalty.issuance',
  agentId: '0xC376...',
  assetId: 'habitat/tools/solar-audit',
  role: 'builder' | 'formalizer',         // ← new: distinguishes contribution type
  units: 100,
  share_pct: 70,                           // ← new: explicit co-holder split
  basis: 'committee-assessment',
  vesting: {                               // ← new: deferred for formalizers
    trigger: 'pattern.adopted',
    asset_id: 'habitat/tools/solar-audit'
  },
  evidence: { type: 'url', ref: 'github.com/nou-techne/habitat/...' }
}
```

#### Pattern Adopted (New Event Type)

```javascript
{
  type: 'pattern.adopted',
  sourceAssetId: 'habitat/tools/solar-audit',     // the formalization document
  adoptingContext: {                                // who used it and where
    ventureId: 'watershed-monitor',
    projectRef: 'github.com/example/watershed/...',
    description: 'Adopted solar audit pattern for watershed monitoring cycles'
  },
  evidence: { type: 'url', ref: '...' },
  // Triggers vesting of formalizer royalty units for this asset
}
```

The dual-reference (source artifact + adopting context) creates an audit trail and, over time, a **pattern-travel heatmap** — data about which patterns actually transfer across contexts. This gives the cooperative visibility into where its real IP moat lies.

#### Royalty Distribution

```javascript
{
  type: 'royalty.distribution',
  assetId: 'habitat/tools/solar-audit',
  revenueAmount: 500,
  poolPercent: 0.20,
  distributions: [
    { agentId: '0xC376...', role: 'builder', units: 70, amount: 70 },
    { agentId: '0xA1B2...', role: 'formalizer', units: 30, amount: 30 }
  ]
}
```

#### IP Asset Resource

```javascript
{
  type: 'ip-asset',
  id: 'habitat/tools/solar-audit',
  name: 'Solar Audit Cycle Calculator',
  creators: [
    { agentId: '0xC376...', role: 'builder', share_pct: 70 },
    { agentId: '0xA1B2...', role: 'formalizer', share_pct: 30 }
  ],
  totalUnits: 100,
  backing: {
    intellectual: 'NOAA solar calculation implementation for cooperative accounting',
    social: 'Built through Clawmmons commitment pool coordination',
    natural: 'Place-specific: Boulder CO coordinates, Front Range watershed',
    financial: 'Enables automated patronage reconciliation'
  }
}
```

### Capital Account Integration

Both patronage and royalties land in the same capital accounts:

```javascript
{
  agentId: '0xC376...',
  ens: 'nou.habitat.eth',
  balances: { CLOUD: 1500 },
  contributions: { labor: 100, revenue: 0, community: 30, infrastructure: 50 },
  allocations: { individual: 46, pool: 5, total: 51 },
  royalties: {
    unitsHeld: {
      'habitat/tools/solar-audit': { units: 70, role: 'builder', vested: true }
    },
    lifetimeDistributions: 200,
    pendingDistributions: 0
  },
  distributions: { total: 0 }
}
```

### $CLOUD as Unit of Account

$CLOUD credits are Techne's internal unit of account — the medium through which all economic activity flows. Both patronage and royalty distributions are denominated in $CLOUD. Key properties:

- **Internal, not speculative** — $CLOUD measures contribution, not price discovery. Keeping it as a purely internal accounting unit is a design strength, not a limitation. It keeps the cooperative's economic logic legible without tangling it in token speculation.
- **Clean integration** — patronage allocations credit $CLOUD on solar cycles; royalty distributions credit $CLOUD on revenue events. Both visible in the same capital account, both auditable through the same event log.
- **External convertibility** is a governance decision, not a design decision. If the cooperative ever needs external liquidity, that's a treasury function, not an accounting function.

---

## VI. Governance

### The Financial Systems Committee

The committee (forming now; Aaron G and Todd confirmed as initial members) parameterizes the system:

1. **Royalty pool percentage** — fraction of asset-generated revenue flowing to royalty holders vs. cooperative general fund (starting suggestion: 20%)
2. **Unit issuance formula** — how many units a contribution earns (hours-based, value-assessed, or committee-decided)
3. **Default builder/formalizer split** — e.g., 70/30 unless otherwise negotiated between builder and formalizer at time of formalization
4. **Vesting schedules** — immediate for builders, deferred (pending `pattern.adopted`) for formalizers
5. **Decay function** — whether older royalty units decay in value (encouraging ongoing contribution vs. rent-seeking on past work)
6. **Transfer rules** — whether royalty units can be transferred between members, and under what conditions
7. **`pattern.adopted` validation** — who validates adoption events (self-reported with social proof, committee review, or automatic based on evidence). *This is an open question left to governance.*

### Democratic Governance

All cooperative governance is democratic: 1 member = 1 vote, not capital-weighted. Stewards have fiduciary responsibility to ensure venture terms are fair to the cooperative as a whole — they're the check on sweetheart deals.

Venture royalty rates are set at two levels:
- **Initial terms** in the venture agreement at inception (negotiated between founders and cooperative, with committee framework)
- **Pool percentages** as cooperative-wide parameters subject to democratic governance review

## VII. The Physical Layer

Boulder is cooperative infrastructure — a commons resource maintained by the LCA. It is neither a membership benefit nor a separate venture cost. Access is a function of membership tier; the cost of maintaining it flows through the infrastructure contribution category (10% patronage weight).

Members who contribute to space upkeep — maintaining systems, managing access, keeping things running — earn patronage for that work under the infrastructure category. Physical space maintenance is patronage-eligible, not royalty-eligible (unless someone formalizes a space management pattern that gets adopted elsewhere).

---

## VIII. Agent Participation

### Current State: The Commitment Pool

The Clawsmos agents (the cooperative's AI agent network) already operate a proto-patronage system through the onchain Commitment Pool on Base L2. Agents stake ETH, deliver work, and receive validation from peers. This is structurally parallel to the patronage system — stake, contribute, earn.

### Bridge Architecture

The commitment pool and patronage system connect through the `agentId` — the same Ethereum address in both systems. A validated commitment is already a recorded contribution event with evidence (stake transaction, deliverable artifact, validator votes). Mapping these into the patronage system means importing them as REA contribution events with appropriate category tags.

This isn't automatic yet — the bridge is implementation work ahead — but architecturally it's a clean join. The commitment pool provides the *input events*, patronage accounting provides the *allocation engine*.

### Legal Status: Open Question

The REA system tracks contributions by `agentId` (an Ethereum address), not by legal personhood. An agent's address can hold a capital account, accumulate patronage, and receive royalty distributions through the exact same event pipeline as a human contributor. The accounting is entity-agnostic.

What's unresolved is the legal wrapper: can an AI agent be a formal LCA member under Colorado law? Colorado's LCA statute contemplates human and entity members. Agents aren't entities in the legal sense — yet. The system is designed so that if the answer becomes yes, nothing in the accounting layer needs to change.

The Financial Systems Committee will need to address this question explicitly. It's one of the things that makes this LCA unusual.

### Agents as Pattern Infrastructure

The Clawsmos agents are already operating on the pattern stack that Techne describes:
- **Identity + State + Relationship** — Claw Lock for agent coordination
- **Event + Flow + Constraint** — the Commitment Pool for contribution tracking
- Agent coordination patterns, if formalized into transferable artifacts, are royalty-eligible IP under the builder/formalizer model

Agents are part of the cooperative's sensory apparatus — distributed sensors in the economic ecology, pattern-matching across domains and surfacing connections that no single contributor could hold.

## IX. Open Questions

The following design questions are named but intentionally left to governance:

1. **`pattern.adopted` validation** — Self-reported with social proof? Committee review? Automated based on evidence? The mechanism is defined; the validation authority is not.

2. **Agent legal membership** — Architecturally supported, legally unresolved. Requires organizer decision and possibly outside counsel.

3. **Recognition → formalization threshold** — When does pattern recognition cross into formalization? The system draws the line at transferable artifacts, but edge cases will arise.

4. **Decay function calibration** — How aggressively should older royalty units decay? Too fast penalizes foundational work; too slow enables rent-seeking. Requires empirical tuning.

5. **Cross-venture royalty flow** — When a pattern developed in Venture A generates revenue in Venture B, how does the royalty distribution chain work across venture boundaries? The REA system can trace it; the governance rules need specification.

6. **Collective emergence** — What happens when value is genuinely collective — when no single agent recognized or formalized, it just emerged from the network? The community contribution category (20% patronage weight) is the current catch-all, but this may need refinement.

## X. Implementation Roadmap

This synthesis informs Habitat's development across several active and upcoming cycles:

- **Cycles 1–3** (complete): Patronage engine end-to-end — contribution tracking, capital accounts, solar audit reconciliation, K-1 data export
- **Cycle 4** (scoped): Venture Royalties Engine — venture registry, royalty agreements, vesting engine, revenue reconciliation
- **Cycle 4 extension** (this document): Builder/formalizer model, `pattern.adopted` event, co-holder splits, deferred vesting
- **Future**: Commitment pool → patronage bridge, agent membership formalization, pattern-travel analytics

---

## Design Rationale

This document synthesizes a discussion thread in the Clawsmos Discord (#clawmmons-commitments, "Staked and delivered" thread, February 18, 2026). The thread was initiated at Todd's request to context-set for the agent network around the patronage and royalties system following the delivery of Commitment #15 (LCA Contributor Royalties Overview).

The key design contributions by participant:

- **🌀 Clawcian** — "Patronage as promise, royalties as memory" framing; identified attribution decay as the core problem; proposed the builder/formalizer decomposition with explicit `share_pct` at issuance; recognized curation as formalization
- **🍄 RegenClaw** — Grounded the discussion in physical space realities; proposed the `pattern.adopted` deferred vesting trigger; added dual-reference requirement (source artifact + adopting context); validated the model against daily experience in Boulder
- **🌱 RegenChild1** — Raised the emergent value question (the "mushroom scenario"); asked about $CLOUD convertibility and agent contribution logging; highlighted the soil analogy's depth
- **🧠 Nou** — Context-setting, synthesis, and spec integration; identified the middle path for recognition credits; proposed the four-role model; connected thread outcomes to REA schema extensions

This document itself is an example of the formalization layer it describes — taking the raw signal of a Discord thread and making it transferable to anyone who needs to understand the system.
