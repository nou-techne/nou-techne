# How You Earn at Techne: A Guide to Patronage & Royalties

*For new and prospective members of RegenHub / Techne*

## What is Techne?

Techne is a venture studio in Boulder, Colorado. It's structured as a cooperative — specifically a **Limited Cooperative Association (LCA)** under Colorado law. That means it's owned and governed by the people who do the work, not by outside investors.

The cooperative provides shared infrastructure — a physical workspace, legal structure, planning capacity, and tools — for ventures (projects, products, companies) to form, develop, and generate value. Think of it as fertile ground: Techne doesn't dictate what grows, but it creates the conditions for things to grow well.

The formal entity is **RegenHub, LCA**. Techne is the studio brand.

## How Membership Works

There are three tiers:

**Community Members** — Anyone can join at this level. You get read access to what the cooperative is doing, a voice in governance discussions, and a seat at the table. No cost, no obligation.

**Contributors** — Active participants who do work for the cooperative or its ventures. This is where you start earning. Contributors are the backbone — they build tools, manage operations, produce research, maintain infrastructure, and participate in governance.

**Stewards** — Leadership roles with fiduciary responsibility. Stewards ensure the cooperative stays true to its purpose and that decisions serve the whole, not just individual ventures.

If you're reading this as a prospective member, you'd likely start as a Community member and move to Contributor when you begin doing work.

## The Big Idea: Two Ways to Earn

Most workplaces have one way to pay you: a salary, a wage, or a fee for service. Techne has two complementary systems that work together:

### 1. Patronage — "What did you contribute recently?"

Patronage is how cooperatives distribute surplus (what's left after expenses). At Techne, it works like this:

- You do work — write code, manage the space, bring in revenue, participate in governance, build tools
- Your work is tracked in four categories, each with a different weight:
  - **Labor (40%)** — Direct work on ventures and deliverables
  - **Revenue (30%)** — Bringing in income, client work, market development
  - **Community (20%)** — Governance participation, mentoring, helping others, relationship-building
  - **Infrastructure (10%)** — Maintaining shared resources, systems, and the physical space
- At regular intervals, the cooperative calculates how much each contributor put in and allocates surplus proportionally
- Your share is credited to your **capital account** — a running balance of what the cooperative owes you

This is the standard cooperative mechanism. It's legally structured under Subchapter K of the tax code (IRC 704(b)), which means it's compliant, auditable, and generates proper tax documents (K-1s) at year end.

**What patronage rewards:** Showing up and doing the work, right now, this cycle.

### 2. Royalties — "What lasting value did you create?"

Some work produces value that endures far beyond the time you spent on it. A tool you build might be used for years. A process you documented might be adopted by dozens of other organizations. A design pattern you formalized might become a core part of the cooperative's offerings.

Patronage alone would only credit you during the period you did that work. Royalties fix that:

- When you create something with lasting value (we call these **IP assets**), the cooperative issues **royalty units** — your claim on future revenue from that asset
- When the asset generates revenue (through licensing, usage fees, or venture income), a portion flows to the royalty holders
- This happens automatically, for as long as the asset produces value

**What royalties reward:** Creating things that keep working after you stop.

### How They Work Together

The two systems are additive, not alternative. A contributor who maintains the building's systems (patronage) AND wrote a tool that gets licensed externally (royalties) earns from both. They're separate streams that flow into the same account.

Think of it this way:
- **Patronage** = your paycheck for this period's work
- **Royalties** = residual income from things you built that keep generating value

## What Counts as Royalty-Eligible Work?

Not everything earns royalties. The distinction is straightforward:

**Earns patronage AND royalties:**
- Software tools and libraries
- Design patterns and architectural specifications
- Research papers and frameworks
- Training materials and curriculum
- Operational playbooks that others can adopt
- Creative works (writing, design, media)
- Data models and schemas
- Documentation that makes a process transferable to new contexts

**Earns patronage only:**
- Routine maintenance and upkeep
- Administrative and coordination work
- Governance participation
- Community engagement
- One-time tasks

The key question: **did your work produce something that someone else can use independently of you?** If yes, it's potentially royalty-eligible. If it was valuable but ephemeral, it earns patronage.

## Two Kinds of Creators

One of Techne's innovations is recognizing that creating lasting value isn't just about building the original thing. There are two distinct creative roles:

### Builders
You wrote the code. You designed the system. You created the original artifact. Your royalty units are issued when the work is complete.

### Formalizers
You took something that worked in one context and made it transferable — wrote the documentation, abstracted the template, created the guide that lets someone else replicate it without you. Your royalty units are issued when someone outside the original context actually adopts the pattern.

**Why this matters:** In most organizations, the person who builds something and the person who makes it teachable are assumed to be the same person. In practice, they rarely are. Techne credits both. The builder and the formalizer split the royalty units, with percentages agreed upon when the formalization happens.

**Example:** You build a novel scheduling system for the workspace. That's builder work — you get royalty units. Later, someone else writes a detailed guide explaining how any co-working space could implement the same system. That's formalizer work — they get royalty units too, once another space actually uses the guide.

## $CLOUD: The Unit of Account

All earnings at Techne — both patronage and royalties — are denominated in **$CLOUD credits**. $CLOUD is Techne's internal unit of account. It's how the cooperative measures and tracks value.

- Patronage allocations are credited in $CLOUD
- Royalty distributions are credited in $CLOUD
- Your capital account balance is in $CLOUD
- Using cooperative services, tools, and infrastructure is denominated in $CLOUD

$CLOUD is an internal accounting unit, not a speculative token. It exists to make the cooperative's economic flows legible and fair, not to trade on an exchange.

## Your Capital Account

Every contributor has a **capital account** — a ledger that tracks everything the cooperative owes you and everything you've received. It shows:

- **Contributions** — what you've put in, by category
- **Patronage allocations** — your share of surplus from each period
- **Royalty positions** — which IP assets you hold units in
- **Royalty distributions** — income from your royalty-bearing assets
- **Distributions** — what you've actually withdrawn

This is a standard cooperative accounting structure, just made more granular and transparent than most cooperatives achieve. You can see exactly why you earned what you earned, traced back to specific contributions and events.

## Governance: Who Decides the Rules?

Techne is democratically governed. **One member, one vote** — regardless of how much you've contributed or how many royalty units you hold. Your voice in governance is equal to everyone else's.

The specific parameters of the patronage and royalty systems are set by the **Financial Engineering Committee**:

- What percentage of asset revenue goes to royalty holders (currently proposed at 20%)
- How royalty units are valued and issued
- Default splits between builders and formalizers
- Whether older royalty units decay over time
- Rules around transferring royalty units

These are cooperative-wide settings, not individual negotiations. The committee proposes, the membership votes. If you disagree with a parameter, you have a democratic path to change it.

## How Work Gets Tracked

Techne uses an event-based accounting system. Every contribution is recorded as an event with:

- **Who** did it (your member identity)
- **What** they did (description and category)
- **Evidence** (a link to the work — code commit, document, deliverable)
- **When** it happened

This creates an auditable trail. You can always answer "why did I earn this?" by looking at the event log. Nothing is opaque or discretionary — the math is traceable.

For royalties specifically, the system also tracks:
- When IP assets are created and who holds units
- When assets generate revenue and how it's distributed
- When formalized patterns get adopted externally

## Practical Questions

**How do I start earning?**
Become a Contributor. Do work. Your contributions are tracked and flow into patronage calculations. If your work produces lasting artifacts, discuss royalty unit issuance with the Financial Engineering Committee.

**When do I get paid?**
Patronage allocations happen on regular cycles. Royalty distributions happen when assets generate revenue (irregular, depends on market activity). Both credit your capital account. Distributions (actual withdrawals) follow cooperative policy.

**Can I lose royalty units?**
Royalty units may decay over time, depending on the governance parameters the committee sets. This is intentional — it prevents someone from earning royalties once and collecting forever without further contribution. The decay rate is a cooperative decision.

**What if I leave?**
Your capital account balance and vested royalty units are yours. The specifics of how departing members settle their accounts follow the LCA's operating agreement.

**What if I contribute to multiple ventures?**
Each venture's assets are tracked separately. You can hold royalty units in multiple assets across multiple ventures. They all flow into your single capital account.

**Do I need to understand all of this to participate?**
No. The system is designed to be transparent for those who want to look, but it doesn't require constant attention. Do your work, track your contributions, and the accounting system handles the rest. The capital account dashboard shows you where you stand at any time.

## The Bigger Picture

Most organizations track extraction well and contribution poorly. Traditional accounting tells you how much revenue came in and how much went out, but it can't tell you *who created the conditions for that revenue* or *whose idea three years ago made this product possible.*

Techne's system is designed to make contribution visible across time. Patronage handles the present. Royalties handle the past-that-keeps-producing. Together, they create an economic environment where:

- People are rewarded for the work they do today
- People are rewarded for the lasting value they created
- Documentation and knowledge-sharing are economically motivated, not afterthoughts
- The cooperative can see where its real value comes from
- Democratic governance keeps the rules fair

You don't need to think about all of this on day one. Start by showing up, doing good work, and paying attention to what others need. The system is built to notice.
