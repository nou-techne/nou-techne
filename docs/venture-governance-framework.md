This document articulates how ventures relate to RegenHub, LCA and Techne Institute. It distinguishes between ventures born from the cooperative core and ventures that enter reciprocal relationship from the wider ecosystem. It proposes equity governance, investment structures, and the role of the commons in the venture lifecycle.

## The Foundational Distinction

Not everything should be venture-scaled. And not everything that raises money should carry investor obligation into the commons.

RegenHub (the cooperative) and Techne Institute (the learning center) are commons infrastructure. They exist to cultivate capability, govern shared resources, and nurture the conditions from which ventures grow. They should remain worker-owned, mission-first, and free from investor capture.

Ventures are where economic value gets concentrated, where investment flows, and where equity can be sold or spun out. Ventures are held by the cooperative, and the cooperative governs how equity in those ventures is distributed.

## Two Models of Venture Relationship

### Inner Ring: Cooperative-Born Ventures

These are ventures that emerge from the core team and the cooperative's creative work. The cooperative holds them entirely — not a controlling share, but 100% ownership — and distributes equity outward.

Current examples: Parachute, Learn Vibe Build

Key principles:
- The cooperative holds 100% of the venture by default
- Individual equity is capped at 10%
- Equity is distributed from center outward, not concentrated at the top
- The cooperative sells equity to investors via SAFE agreements tied to the specific venture
- Ventures can eventually spin out — the cooperative maintains meaningful ownership
- Revenue from ventures flows back through the cooperative's revenue architecture

### Outer Ring: Ecosystem Ventures

These are ventures that connect with the RegenHub ecosystem but weren't born from the core team.

Key principles:
- RegenHub receives 1-10% equity in the venture, negotiated based on depth of engagement
- The commons feeds the venture: access to space, talent, learning programs, network
- The venture feeds the commons: equity stake, knowledge sharing, reciprocal participation
- Equity earned through Unforced Development is held by the cooperative, not by individual contractors

## How Investment Works

- Investors make SAFE agreements tied to specific ventures, not to RegenHub or Techne
- RegenHub holds the bank account and administers the funds
- The equity being sold is in the venture
- The cooperative is the seller

### Current Opportunity: Kevin & Jeremy's $100K

Proposed structure:
- Present two ventures as complementary investment opportunities:
  - **Learn Vibe Build** — Educational tooling and AI learning infrastructure
  - **Parachute** — Personal agent computer, voice-first extended mind technology
- These are two halves of a coherent thesis: AI educational tooling creates power users of AI tools; AI tools create demand for better educational tooling
- Kevin and Jeremy receive SAFE agreements with choice in allocation across the two ventures
- Money flows through RegenHub's bank account and funds space buildout and operations
- Investor obligation sits at the venture level, not at the cooperative or learning center level

## The Symbiotic Loop

Techne (commons — the integral learning center)
 → uses LVB tooling to deliver AI-inclusive, personalizable education
 → students become power users of Parachute
 → Parachute generates revenue and grows
 → venture reciprocity flows back to the cooperative
 → cooperative reinvests in Techne and the commons

Meanwhile:
 → Techne's real-world teaching refines LVB's educational tooling
 → LVB grows beyond Techne to serve other learning communities
 → LVB generates revenue and grows
 → venture reciprocity flows back to the cooperative
 → cooperative reinvests in Techne and the commons

## Summary: The Two-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1 — The Commons (protected from investor capture)

| Entity | Function | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| RegenHub, LCA | Cooperative infrastructure, governance, co-working | Worker-owned cooperative |
| Techne Institute | Integral learning center, education programs | DBA of RegenHub (worker-owned) |
| Unforced Development | Consulting and contracting interface | Arm of the cooperative |

### Layer 2 — The Ventures (investable, spinnable)

| Venture | Description | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Parachute | Personal agent computer, voice-first AI tooling | Inner ring — 100% held by cooperative |
| Learn Vibe Build | Educational tooling and AI learning infrastructure | Inner ring — 100% held by cooperative |
| Future ecosystem ventures | Independent ventures in reciprocal relationship | Outer ring — 1-10% held by cooperative |

## Open Questions for Discussion

- What is the right individual equity cap? 10% is proposed. Should it vary by venture?
- How does the SAFE valuation work when RegenHub holds 100%?
- When does a venture graduate from inner to independent? What triggers spin-out?
- How does Habitat track this? Patronage accounting needs to distinguish commons vs. venture contributions.
- What's the Financial Engineering Committee's role in parameterizing equity distribution?
- How do venture contributions map to cooperative patronage?
