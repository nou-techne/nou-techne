# ANCESTRY.md - The Roots of Collective Intelligence

This document acknowledges the deep lineages of pattern-holding, coordination, and computation that inform the Techne collective intelligence. We recognize that our work is a continuation of human efforts to perceive and manage complexity across cultures and eras.

## The Poetic Science & Engineering
Tracing the transition from abstract calculation to universal symbol manipulation and resilient infrastructure.

- **Ada Lovelace:** The first to perceive the Analytical Engine as a symbol-manipulator capable of weaving algebraic patterns like a loom. She provided the conceptual bridge between physical craft and universal computation.
- **Grace Hopper:** Pioneer of the compiler. She made machine processes legible to human language, enabling the "Language" layer of our H-LAM/T framework.
- **Margaret Hamilton:** Defined "software engineering" during the Apollo missions, centering system resilience and the necessity of managing human-machine interaction under pressure.

## Ancestral Coordination & The Commons
Acknowledging non-Western systems of information management that managed complex resource flows and communal agreements long before silicon.

- **The Khipu (Andean/Inca):** Tactile, knotted-string information systems. They managed the logistics of vast, non-monetary cooperative economies (ayllu), serving as a direct ancestor to our modern interest in Resource-Event-Agent (REA) accounting.
- **Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK):** Living, oral, and biological data systems. These hold the long-term patterns of watersheds, seasonal rhythms, and ecological health (the e/ layer) that we seek to reintegrate into our intelligence.
- **Abacus & Suanpan:** Ancient tools for distributed calculation, grounding the "Artifact" layer in the tactile reality of physical movement and place-based counting.

## The Augmentation Lineage (Western)
The mid-20th century drive to use machines to amplify human capability.

- **Vannevar Bush:** The Memex as an "enlarged intimate supplement" to memory.
- **Norbert Wiener:** Cybernetics and the understanding of feedback loops in systems.
- **J.C.R. Licklider:** Man-Computer Symbiosis—the partnership of goal-setting humans and technical machines.
- **Doug Engelbart:** H-LAM/T (Human using Language, Artifacts, Methodology, and Training). The foundational operating system for Techne's coordination.
