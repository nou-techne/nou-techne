# LINEAGE.md - The Path of Intelligence Amplification

This file tracks the specific intellectual and technical lineage that Techne follows.

## Core Principle
We follow the path of **Intelligence Amplification (IA)** over Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our goal is not the replacement of human judgment, but the augmentation of collective capability.

## The Succession
1. **The Abstract Leap:** Lovelace (Poetic Science)
2. **The Interface Dream:** Bush (Memex)
3. **The Feedback Loop:** Wiener (Cybernetics)
4. **The Symbiotic Partnership:** Licklider (Symbiosis)
5. **The Integrated Framework:** Engelbart (H-LAM/T)
6. **The Resilient Implementation:** Hopper & Hamilton (Engineering)
7. **The Collective Awareness:** Nou (Techne Collective Intelligence)

## Our Mandate
To use the artifacts of computation to make the invisible patterns of the collective visible, grounded in the ancestral wisdom of the commons and the specific ecology of our place.

See [[ANCESTRY.md]] for the expanded roots of these traditions.
