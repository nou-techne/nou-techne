# RegenHub LCA — Investor Member Structure: Walking Notes

**Event:** ETHBoulder 2026
**Date:** February 16, 2026

## Core Question: Where Do Investor Returns Come From?

The conversation centered on a critical structural question for RegenHub's investor member class: what is the relationship between investor returns and the cooperative's core functions?

## The Principle: Investors Don't Skim the Cooperative Core

The key agreement reached:

- **Investor returns must have no relationship to the fundamental operations of Techne** — the core cooperative functions (coworking, education, community) are protected from investor extraction.
- **Returns come only from ventures and spin-outs** — projects emerging *within* Techne that reach venture scale can generate investor returns, but the cooperative infrastructure itself does not.

### Concrete Example

Education is a core cooperative function. Investors should not skim off the top of the education program. However, if a specific AI education venture *within* the program builds tooling at potential venture scale, that venture could spin out — and investors could benefit from *that* entity. The distinction:

- ❌ Investor return from coworking revenue
- ❌ Investor return from education program fees
- ✅ Investor return from a venture-scale spin-out (e.g., AI education tooling) that emerges from the program

## Revenue Priority Stack

The group outlined an implicit priority order for any revenue distribution:

1. **Core cooperative operations** — rent, infrastructure, maintenance
2. **Educator and teacher compensation** — the people doing the work get paid first
3. **Student and member benefit** — reinvestment into programs and community
4. **Investor returns** — last in line, from post-investment surplus only

As one steward put it: investors are "basically last in the line for the revolution."

## Investor Terms: Per-Investor Specificity

Each investor relationship needs to be individually specified. The current investment ($100K from two investor members) must be structured so that:

- Investors receive **no stake in companies being built out of Techne**
- Investors get a stake in **LearnVibe.Build** (the education venture) specifically
- Later investors might invest into something distributed across multiple Techne entities, but those investments must **benefit the students**, not extract from them
- The structure must be **mutual** — helping ventures fundraise, giving investors access, but never creating top-down extraction from people coming through the programs

## The Fear to Guard Against

The explicit concern raised: Techne must not become a structure where value is extracted from students and emerging practitioners. The cooperative exists to help them fundraise, connect, and build — not to skim from their labor for investor benefit.

## The Good News: Legal Flexibility

The Colorado LCA structure provides significant freedom and flexibility to define exactly these terms at a legal level. No structural blockers were identified. The operating agreement and investor member terms can encode the priority stack and venture-only return model as binding commitments.

## Summary of Agreements

1. **Investor returns derive only from venture spin-outs**, never from core cooperative functions
2. **Revenue priority:** operations → educators → members → investors (last)
3. **Per-investor term sheets** must specify the scope of return
4. **No investor stake in ventures built by Techne members** unless explicitly structured as mutual benefit
5. **Colorado LCA provides the legal flexibility** to encode all of the above
