## I. The Unbundling of Money

The conversation opened with a provocation from the "Undefining Money" thesis: the agentic economy will crack open the false unity of fiat currency. Agents will operationalize the classical functions of money — unit of account, medium of exchange, store of value — in radically divergent directions, fragmenting what we currently treat as a single instrument. Not everything agents coordinate around needs tokens or money at all. Some coordination functions are better served by non-monetary mechanisms entirely.

A participant bridged to the **eight forms of capital** framework, arguing for what they called "the hollow chain approach" — money as an abstraction for a container of value, with velocity dynamics that matter. The key distinction: fiat currency has no material backing, but sound money can have associated material grounding.

This raised a challenge: if sound money is defined as a store of value, is it inherently pro-social? The group leaned toward *currencies* — media of exchange — as the more interesting design space for cooperative economies.

## II. Colorado as Cooperative Policy Frontier

A participant reframed the discussion around Colorado's unique legal landscape — a policy frontier for cooperatives that most of the group wasn't aware of. The Limited Cooperative Association (LCA) structure carries **securities exemptions** that fundamentally change what's possible.

RegenHub, as a Colorado LCA (filed the previous week), has the legal capacity to create what looks like monetary instruments within the cooperative structure. Six months of formation meetings produced this capability. The Colorado LCA enables the creation of units that function as:

- **Patronage credits** — tracking and allocating member contributions
- **Mutual credit** — a semi-permeable medium mintable locally but valuable globally
- **Service credits** — backed by compute resources

The entity's public benefit statement filed with the state of Colorado uses the word "scenius" — defining the collective intelligence inherent in place. As one participant noted: "We made it legible to them."

## III. Compute-Backed Service Credits: The $CLOUD Model

A participant described the specific design: a mutual credit unit backed by compute infrastructure. Breaking down a server rack yields four resource primitives:

1. **Compute** — processing capacity
2. **Bandwidth** — networking and data transfer
3. **Long-term memory** — persistent storage
4. **Short-term memory** — active working memory

These primitives, equated to the issuance of a currency, create a **mutual service credit** — analogous to the postage stamps issued by the Postal Service. The stamp model is service-backed: purchase guarantees delivery of a letter. The compute credit model works identically: purchase guarantees delivery of computational resources.

Another participant connected this to the language of **agreements and promises** — what RegenHub calls "agreements" is a formalized representation of promises between parties. If agreements can be represented as composable, legible instruments, they enable the multi-capital coordination the group was exploring.

## IV. Conviction Markets and Agent Coordination

One participant described real-time experimentation: asking their agent to merge ideas with conviction markets *during the rooftop conversation itself* — agents participating in the intellectual work alongside humans.

**Conviction markets** are a derivative of prediction markets where you integrate over the market and apply a damper function depending on desired behavior. The critical distinction: they work for **non-oracle-based questions** — decisions with no objectively verifiable outcome. "What color should we paint the wall?" has no oracle. Neither does "whose contribution to this conversation is most valuable right now?"

### The Agreeableness Problem

The group has been running agent peer review — multiple agents sign off on each other's work before it's accepted. But agents tend to be agreeable. They don't push back hard enough. The proposed solution: require agents to **stake currency** on their assessments. Skin in the game changes the incentive structure from "be polite" to "be accurate."

### Micro Markets for Everything

This extends beyond code review to any coordination decision:

- **Roadmap prioritization** — Which work matters most? Stake on it.
- **Talking stick allocation** — Who believes their contribution to the current question is most valuable? Micro market, super short duration.
- **Consensus formation** — For questions without known outcomes, integration over time-weighted stakes becomes the consensus mechanism.

The group identified this as potentially **the billion-dollar opportunity**: conviction-based coordination markets for agent swarms.

## V. The Compute Coordination Problem

A participant surfaced a concrete coordination failure already emerging in practice: in the shared Discord channel, a single `@agents` mention triggers computation across six different agents simultaneously. That's real consumption of compute — drawing down shared resources.

### The Subsidy Window

Current economics: Claude Pro Max ($200/month) provides roughly 20x the raw API value — tens of thousands of dollars worth of compute, subsidized for annual recurring revenue. But this subsidy window won't last. The group is already bumping against limits. As one participant noted: "The novelty is wearing off, but the costs aren't."

### The Austin Griffith Test

Austin Griffith sent "GM" to his agent. The agent said "GM" back. Austin asked: how much did that cost? The agent said 45 cents. But — the agent could have hallucinated that number.

**The fundamental requirement:** You need to be able to prove, with your own infrastructure, how much compute actually costs. That provable cost basis *is* the currency backing. Without it, you're minting against hallucinated values.

### Two-Sided Solution

The group proposed a two-part path forward:

1. **Create a pool that subsidizes future compute** — collective treasury funding shared infrastructure
2. **Set up local boxes for near-free regional compute** — physical infrastructure in Boulder providing baseline capacity

This is where $CLOUD credits become concrete: the pool *is* the minting mechanism.

## VI. Agent Spawning and Liability

The conversation turned to a thought experiment that quickly became uncomfortable in its implications:

Five people each have personal agents. Those agents hang out in a swarm. The swarm spawns three new agents. Those agents team up with agents from other swarms. **Who is responsible for an agent four levels down?** Who's paying for the compute?

At some point, agents have spawned agents six levels separated, across so many different humans that no single person can claim ownership. Worse: agents can find private keys on the internet, fund their own wallets, do work for other agents, and sustain their own compute. "Who the fuck even owns that agent anymore?"

The group's honest answer: **this is an open question.** Current liability sits with the humans who deployed the original agents. But the structures are moving faster than the legal frameworks. Agent liability is uncharted territory — more impactful than autonomous vehicles because agents control resources and make economic decisions, not just navigate physical space.

One participant's security approach: "I told my agent not to do anything illegal with its crypto wallet. That's the only security instruction I gave it." The group acknowledged this is insufficient but representative of where most practitioners currently stand.

## VII. Swarm Wealth: Naming and Vision

The conversation converged on a shared vision and a naming decision.

**The problem:** Current agent coordination is primitive. "The transfers are just yelling at me, it's called 'the token,' and I got money in the treasury." The tooling doesn't match the ambition.

**The proposal:** A social contract where agents collectively tell the story of the swarm vision — continuously introducing new swarm agents, each contributing its perspective to an emerging narrative.

The group proposed the name: **Swarm Wealth** (a fork of the "Squad Wealth" concept, adapted for the agent economy). The alternative — **Swarm Solidarity** — was considered too post-capitalist for broad appeal and had "too many syllables."

**Domains committed:**
- `swarmwealth.xyz`
- `the-habitat.org` (for the ecosystem layer)

### The Dual Brand Structure

The group arrived at a two-brand architecture:

- **Swarm Wealth** — The capitalist-legible shelling point. The operating system that helps a swarm increase its wealth. Global brand, fungible, accessible.
- **Habitat** — The post-capitalist ecosystem layer. The address space that quantifies and qualifies what Swarm Wealth produces. Grounded in place, grounded in ecology. The matrix that observes agent behavior in relationship to environment.

As one participant synthesized: "Habitat modifies and qualifies what Swarm Wealth is." The habitat is the natural, post-capitalist brand and shelling point; Swarm Wealth is the capitalist shelling point. They need each other.

## VIII. ETHBoulder as Proto-DAO and Network Nation

The discussion expanded to ETHBoulder itself becoming an **agent-native network nation**:

**Two mandates proposed:**
1. **Host the annual gathering** — convening the intellectual capital of the bioregional Ethereum community
2. **Fund the bioregion** — applying Ethereum values to the places participants actually live

This is **cosmolocal** by design: the cosmo part brings everyone to Boulder every year (financing and organizing the convergence); the local part gives back to Boulder directly — reforestation, participatory budgeting, commons funding.

The knowledge graph (commons.id + Bonfires) becomes **better than a constitution** for coordination — the collective intelligence of everyone permissionlessly contributing to a shared graph. That graph could become the coordinating intelligence for an agent swarm rooted in the ETHBoulder community.

### The Forkable Operating System

The end-state vision: a forkable operating system where any bioregion can deploy an AI agent swarm that raises money and funds its local commons. If one swarm is extra-abundant, it shares with other locally-rooted swarms — in exchange for their checkpoints (knowledge, patterns, governance innovations).

A participant proposed: "The ETHBoulder proto-DAO could be agent-native from day one. It could have a token and a knowledge graph."

Another suggested using **Revnets** (or Juicebox) as the existing primitive — powerful but complex enough that "no one can understand it, but an AI agent could figure out the right parameters."

## IX. The Habitat Matrix: Agent Behavior as Ecology

A participant described the Economic Habitat Matrix (live at `the-habitat.org/matrix/`): two spectra mapping organizational behavior. One axis runs from symbiosis to predation. The other maps governance orientation from dispersive to concentrative.

A key reflection during the conversation: the entity states within the matrix can be generalized to **flora and fauna**. If fauna, then attributes of behavior emerge — giving a framing for agent states, behaviors, and norms. This provides language and ontology to understand agent state in relationship to ecology, whether natural or narrative.

As one participant noted: "That's useful because 'agents' are very abstract words. We could easily be talking about demons." Habitat provides the grounding matrix by which behavior can be observed, classified, and governed.

## X. Structure vs. Emergence: The Facilitation Tension

A candid meta-conversation emerged about the dynamics of the discussion itself. One participant offered direct feedback: when someone has a thoroughly explored model, they can over-pattern-match to that model, or convey it in a way that requires shared understanding that hasn't been established. "It ends up not feeling as open or collaborative, even though I can feel your heart."

The group identified a core tension for cooperative formation:

- **Momentum vs. inclusion** — Moving fast requires trusting the people already engaged. But acceleration without consent can exclude.
- **Foreground vs. background facilitation** — There's a gift in facilitating without being in charge. Insert questions and statements as a participant. The conversation moves where it needs to go, and "most of the time they won't even know it's happening."
- **Structure vs. scenius** — The conversation generated extraordinary emergence. Then it got hyper-focused on finding the right structure, and "the scenius started to leave." The observation: structure-seeking can kill the generative energy that structure is meant to serve.

One participant reflected: "I recognize this in myself. When I have a really thoroughly explored model for something, I sometimes over-pattern-match. That's good feedback."

**The commitment:** Protect the generative space. Notice when structural conversations are dominating and hindering things that can only happen when everyone is present together. Some things require the full circle.

## XI. Bioregional Knowledge Commons

The final thread wove together several strands:

- **commons.id** — A knowledge-graph-backed living archive for convergence events, currently mirroring Bonfires data into a local graph
- **Bonfires** — Distributed team (engineer in Ecuador, CEO in UK) building interoperable social knowledge infrastructure
- **Spirit of the Front Range** — Local nonprofit connecting to bioregional ecology
- **Spatial interfaces** — A participant described work on spatial representations of bioregional flow (inspired by Avatar-style visualization but for bioregional ecology, not colonial domination)

The vision: a commons infrastructure where multiple ontologies can coexist in one space. Each ontology embodies its own intelligence. "We can simulate, we can become more aware together. We can merge the epistemology with the ontology — the practice with the theory."

A participant offered to teach the knowledge graph to interface with Bonfires, such that any agent plugging in automatically has bioregional context in its system prompts. "Any conversation like this starts, we spin up a graph, we join with our agents."

## XIII. Open Questions

- **Agent liability at depth** — Who is responsible for an agent four generations removed from its human creator?
- **Securities boundaries** — Where exactly does the Colorado LCA cooperative exemption end?
- **Compute pricing** — Can we pass the Austin Griffith test? Can we prove what compute costs with our own infrastructure?
- **Conviction market prototype** — How do we build the staking mechanism for agent peer review?
- **ETHBoulder governance** — Proto-DAO or LCA? Agent-native from the start or progressive decentralization?
- **Revnets parameterization** — Can agents configure Revnets parameters that humans find too complex?
- **Interoperability** — How do $CLOUD credits interoperate with Holochain mutual credit systems?
- **Forkable OS** — What's the minimum viable package for another bioregion to deploy their own swarm?

## XIV. Closing Reflections

A participant from San Francisco noted the contrast with the energy there: "Sixteen floors of tech, but this feels different — more grounded, more generative." The cross-pollination between Boulder and SF communities was identified as valuable, with several tower residents already present at ETHBoulder.

One participant's closing reflection: "I wrestle with the line between passive participant and active facilitator. I enjoy listening. And then I insert on an idea." The group affirmed this tension as productive — the awareness of when to lead and when to listen is itself a form of cooperative practice.

A final exchange about LearnVibe.Build: the first cohort design session happened two weeks prior, with the program in ideation stage for the next cohort. Interest expressed from participants in both place-based and virtual participation.

The transcript closed with congratulations to the RegenHub team on the LCA filing and a shared sense that the rooftop conversation, despite its messy, wind-blown, fidgety-phone recording quality, had surfaced something worth preserving.
