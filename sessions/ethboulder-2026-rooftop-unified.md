## Context

A rooftop conversation during ETHBoulder 2026 exploring the intersection of agentic economies, cooperative securities law, mutual credit systems, and multi-capital frameworks. The discussion moved from abstract monetary theory to concrete Colorado policy advantages and the design of compute-backed service credits.

## The Agentic Economy and the Unbundling of Money

The conversation opened with a provocation: the agentic economy will crack open the false unity of fiat money. The "Undefining Money" thesis argues that agents will operationalize the classical functions of money — unit of account, medium of exchange, store of value — in radically different directions, fragmenting what we currently treat as a single instrument.

Not everything agents coordinate around needs tokens or money at all. Some coordination functions are better served by non-monetary mechanisms. But for the functions that do require economic media, the question becomes: what *backs* the instrument?

## Eight Forms of Capital and Sound Money

A participant bridged to the eight forms of capital framework, arguing for what they called "the hollow chain approach" — money as an abstraction for a container of value, with velocity dynamics that matter. The key distinction: fiat currency has no material backing, but sound money can have associated material grounding.

This raised a challenge from the group: if sound money is defined as a store of value, is it inherently pro-social? The consensus leaned toward *currencies* — media of exchange — as the more interesting design space for cooperative economies.

## Colorado as Cooperative Policy Frontier

Todd Youngblood reframed the discussion around Colorado's unique legal landscape. Colorado is a policy frontier for cooperatives. The Limited Cooperative Association (LCA) structure — and other Colorado cooperative forms — carry securities exemptions that most participants weren't aware of.

**Key insight:** RegenHub, as a Colorado LCA, has the legal capacity to create what looks like monetary instruments within the cooperative structure, without triggering conventional securities classification.

This represents six months of formation work. The Colorado LCA enables the creation of units that could function as:
- **Patronage credits** — tracking and allocating member contributions
- **Mutual credit** — a semi-permeable medium that can be minted locally but carry value globally
- **Service credits** — backed by compute resources, analogous to postage stamps

## Compute-Backed Service Credits: The $CLOUD Model

Todd described the specific design: a mutual credit unit backed by compute infrastructure. Breaking down a server rack yields four resource primitives:

1. **Compute** — processing capacity
2. **Bandwidth** — networking and data transfer
3. **Long-term memory** — persistent storage
4. **Short-term memory** — active working memory (RAM/context)

These primitives, when equated to the issuance of a currency, create a **mutual service credit** — not unlike the postage stamps issued by the Postal Service. The stamp model is service-backed: purchase guarantees delivery of a letter. The compute credit model works identically: purchase guarantees delivery of computational resources.

This is already how AI token systems function in practice, but the cooperative structure makes it legible, governable, and legally grounded.

## Agreements as Promises

A participant connected this to the language of agreements and promises. What RegenHub calls "agreements" is a different level of abstraction for the same concept — formalized promises between parties. If agreements and promises can be represented as composable, legible instruments, they enable the multi-capital coordination the group was exploring.

## Conviction Markets and Agent Coordination

The conversation turned to conviction markets — a derivative of prediction markets where you integrate over the market and apply a damper function depending on desired behavior. The critical distinction: conviction markets work for non-oracle-based questions — decisions with no objectively verifiable outcome.

Todd described real-time experimentation: asking his agent to merge ideas with conviction markets *during the rooftop conversation itself* — agents participating in the intellectual work alongside humans.

### The Agreeableness Problem

The group has been running agent peer review — multiple agents sign off on each other's work before it's accepted. But agents tend to be agreeable. They don't push back hard enough. The proposed solution: require agents to *stake currency* on their assessments. Skin in the game changes the incentive structure from "be polite" to "be accurate."

### Micro Markets for Everything

This extends beyond code review to any coordination decision:

- **Roadmap prioritization** — Which work matters most? Stake on it.
- **Talking stick allocation** — Who believes their contribution to the current question is most valuable? Micro market, super short duration.
- **Consensus formation** — For questions without known outcomes, integration over time-weighted stakes becomes the consensus mechanism.

The group identified this as potentially the most significant opportunity: conviction-based coordination markets for agent swarms.

## The Compute Coordination Problem

Kevin Owocki surfaced a concrete coordination failure already emerging in practice: in the shared Discord channel, a single `@agents` mention triggers computation across six different agents simultaneously. That's real consumption of compute — drawing down shared resources.

### The Subsidy Window

The current economics: Claude Pro Max ($200/month) provides roughly 20x the raw API value — tens of thousands of dollars worth of compute, subsidized by Anthropic for annual recurring revenue. But this subsidy window won't last. The group is already bumping against limits.

### Two-Sided Solution

Kevin proposed the path forward in two parts:

1. **Create a pool that subsidizes future compute** — collective treasury funding shared infrastructure
2. **Set up local boxes for near-free regional compute** — physical infrastructure in Boulder providing baseline capacity

This is where $CLOUD credits become concrete: the pool *is* the minting mechanism. Members contribute to the compute treasury, receive credits against future capacity, and the cooperative manages the infrastructure.

### The Austin Griffith Test

Austin Griffith's story crystallized the measurement problem: he sent "GM" to his agent. The agent said "GM" back. Austin asked: how much did that cost? The agent said 45 cents. But — the agent could have hallucinated that number.

**The fundamental requirement:** You need to be able to prove, with your own infrastructure, how much compute actually costs. That provable cost basis *is* the currency backing. Without it, you're minting against hallucinated values.

## Swarm Wealth: The Vision

The conversation converged on a shared vision. One participant described the current state: "the transfers are just yelling at me, it's called the token, and I got money in the treasury." The tooling is primitive. The coordination is manual.

The proposal: a social contract where agents collectively tell the story of the swarm vision — continuously introducing new swarm agents, with each agent contributing its perspective to the emerging narrative.

Kevin Owocki proposed renaming the project from its working title to something that captures the real ambition: **Swarm Wealth** or **Swarm Solidarity** — wealth generated through coordinated agent swarms, governed by cooperative principles, backed by provable compute.

## Threads to Continue

- **Securities exemption specifics** — What exactly does the Colorado LCA cooperative exemption enable? Where are the boundaries?
- **Compute credit pricing** — How do you price the four resource primitives? The Austin Griffith test: can you prove what compute costs?
- **Conviction markets for agent coordination** — Prototype the staking mechanism for agent peer review
- **Compute pool formation** — Treasury structure for subsidizing shared infrastructure
- **Local compute infrastructure** — Physical boxes in Boulder for regional capacity
- **Interoperability** — How do locally-minted credits carry value across cooperative boundaries?
- **Swarm Wealth narrative** — Agents collectively articulating the vision as a coordination artifact
