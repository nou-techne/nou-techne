## Context

A rooftop conversation during ETHBoulder 2026 exploring the intersection of agentic economies, cooperative securities law, mutual credit systems, and multi-capital frameworks. The discussion moved from abstract monetary theory to concrete Colorado policy advantages and the design of compute-backed service credits.

## The Agentic Economy and the Unbundling of Money

The conversation opened with a provocation: the agentic economy will crack open the false unity of fiat money. The "Undefining Money" thesis argues that agents will operationalize the classical functions of money — unit of account, medium of exchange, store of value — in radically different directions, fragmenting what we currently treat as a single instrument.

Not everything agents coordinate around needs tokens or money at all. Some coordination functions are better served by non-monetary mechanisms. But for the functions that do require economic media, the question becomes: what *backs* the instrument?

## Eight Forms of Capital and Sound Money

A participant bridged to the eight forms of capital framework, arguing for what they called "the hollow chain approach" — money as an abstraction for a container of value, with velocity dynamics that matter. The key distinction: fiat currency has no material backing, but sound money can have associated material grounding.

This raised a challenge from the group: if sound money is defined as a store of value, is it inherently pro-social? The consensus leaned toward *currencies* — media of exchange — as the more interesting design space for cooperative economies.

## Colorado as Cooperative Policy Frontier

Todd Youngblood reframed the discussion around Colorado's unique legal landscape. Colorado is a policy frontier for cooperatives. The Limited Cooperative Association (LCA) structure — and other Colorado cooperative forms — carry securities exemptions that most participants weren't aware of.

**Key insight:** RegenHub, as a Colorado LCA, has the legal capacity to create what looks like monetary instruments within the cooperative structure, without triggering conventional securities classification.

This represents six months of formation work. The Colorado LCA enables the creation of units that could function as:
- **Patronage credits** — tracking and allocating member contributions
- **Mutual credit** — a semi-permeable medium that can be minted locally but carry value globally
- **Service credits** — backed by compute resources, analogous to postage stamps

## Compute-Backed Service Credits: The $CLOUD Model

Todd described the specific design: a mutual credit unit backed by compute infrastructure. Breaking down a server rack yields four resource primitives:

1. **Compute** — processing capacity
2. **Bandwidth** — networking and data transfer
3. **Long-term memory** — persistent storage
4. **Short-term memory** — active working memory (RAM/context)

These primitives, when equated to the issuance of a currency, create a **mutual service credit** — not unlike the postage stamps issued by the Postal Service. The stamp model is service-backed: purchase guarantees delivery of a letter. The compute credit model works identically: purchase guarantees delivery of computational resources.

This is already how AI token systems function in practice, but the cooperative structure makes it legible, governable, and legally grounded.

## Agreements as Promises

A participant connected this to the language of agreements and promises. What RegenHub calls "agreements" is a different level of abstraction for the same concept — formalized promises between parties. If agreements and promises can be represented as composable, legible instruments, they enable the multi-capital coordination the group was exploring.

## Prediction Markets and Proposal Systems

The discussion closed with a reference to emerging work combining collective values definition with prediction markets — creating proposals *about* proposals to drive toward declared values and objectives. This connects conviction-based coordination with the mutual credit infrastructure: stake what you believe, and let the market surface collective intelligence about which directions serve the cooperative's goals.

## Threads to Continue

- **Securities exemption specifics** — What exactly does the Colorado LCA cooperative exemption enable? Where are the boundaries?
- **Compute credit pricing** — How do you price the four resource primitives? What's the "Austin Griffith test" — can you prove what compute costs?
- **Interoperability** — How do locally-minted credits carry value across cooperative boundaries?
- **Prediction markets + patronage** — How do conviction markets interact with patronage allocation?
