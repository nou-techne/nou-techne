# ETHBoulder 2026: Coalitional Funding & Ethereum Security

**Convergence:** ETHBoulder 2026 (Feb 13–16, Boulder, CO)
**Type:** Closing dialogue / partnership discussion
**Participants:** Griffin (DAO Security Fund), Kevin (Gitcoin / Allo Capital)

---

## Review Summary

A closing-session dialogue between two participants exploring the intersection of **coalitional funding models** and **Ethereum security as a public good**. The conversation moves from a specific partnership proposal (co-funding a Gitcoin grants round for ETH security) to a broader thesis about how coalitions of funders can coordinate to solve shared infrastructure problems.

### Key Themes

1. **Security as Public Good** — Ethereum security benefits all users. The speaker from the DAO Security Fund describes how poor security has undermined crypto nonprofits (specifically naming Giveth's challenges with helping nonprofits hold crypto safely). The thesis: fix security, and crypto becomes usable by everyone.

2. **Coalitional Funding** — Rather than single funders backing public goods alone, the emerging model is *coalitions* coordinating to fund together. Described as a "meta for 2026 and beyond." The prompt: how do we build best practices and infrastructure around coalitional funding?

3. **HOA Model as Public Goods Analogy** — The Homeowners Association model cited as one of the best existing public goods funding structures: a collective pools money to address shared needs. Applied to security: if projects collectively coordinate audit spending, they could fund shared tooling that reduces costs for everyone.

4. **Coalitional Funding Operating System** — A business concept floated: Gitcoin could build infrastructure for managing coalitional funding rounds — essentially an operating system for coordinated funding.

5. **Layered Security Model** — Security is more than audits. It includes white hat funding, tooling across the stack, and ongoing protection as the space evolves. The suggestion of AI agents writing and auditing smart contracts is raised as a possibility, but the response emphasizes that audits are just one layer.

6. **Small Events and Gatherings** — Closing sentiment: intimate events like ETHBoulder are valued for enabling genuine conversation that larger conferences don't allow.

## Edited Dialogue

**Griffin:** ...we've been doing AI experiments around funding public goods. I think the easiest thing for us to partner on is probably another Gitcoin grants funding round with the DAO Security Fund as a sponsor, and some kind of—

**Kevin:** Maybe Sushi co-funds some ETH security.

**Griffin:** Exactly. And coordinate around that, because that's really where I've been focusing. Security has really screwed Giveth — trying to get nonprofits to raise crypto and hold that crypto safely has been a disaster. I've seen so many people lose money in the stupidest ways, as we all have ourselves. If we can fix security, then this stuff will be usable by everyone, and that's really the goal.

**Kevin:** I love that. Security is a public good for everyone who uses Ethereum.

The other thing I'll say is — you and I, when we talked about you launching the DAO fund, I think there's two things I said. The first was, "Wow, you just fell ass-backwards into a lot of money," so kudos to you for that. And the second was, "We could fund ETH security together."

This meta of *coalitional funding* is going to be really exciting. As opposed to you just funding ETH security alone, what if you're rounding up coalitions of people who are funding it together? I think that's going to be a meta in 2026 and beyond.

So: how can we build best practices and infrastructure around coalitional funding? That's a prompt I'll put out there. And maybe Gitcoin could build a business around a coalitional funding operating system. If you want to rap about that, come find me and Griffin — I'm around.

Any final words before we break?

**Griffin:** On the coalitional funding — it's kind of the HOA model. That's almost one of the best public goods funding models: you get a collective of people, they put money in together to solve their collective needs.

There's a lot of that in different niches. In the security space — how much money is everyone throwing into audits? If we could reduce the audit cost by everyone coordinating together to provide shared tooling, that would actually be a net win, a win-win for everybody, and we fund public goods. I think there's a lot of opportunities like that.

**Kevin:** I want to just have one AI agent write a smart contract and the other one audit it. Is that possible? Can we make that possible?

**Griffin:** Probably. But this is the thing — audits aren't... audits are one form of security. The space constantly evolves. You need to fund white hats to protect you, you need different tooling throughout the stack.

**Kevin:** Layered model, yeah.

**Griffin:** Yeah, there's more to security than audits.

**Kevin:** I'm going to signal that we have to wrap soon. Before we do — let's just zoom all the way out. Any final zoomed-out thoughts before we break?

**Griffin:** I really love these small events and gatherings. It's been so nice to hang out with you guys and actually have a chance to speak.

**Kevin:** Alright, thank you Griffin!
