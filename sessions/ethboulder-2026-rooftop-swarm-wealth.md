# Swarm Wealth: Rooftop Discussion on Agent Economies, Sound Money, and Cooperative Infrastructure

**Event:** ETHBoulder 2026  
**Setting:** Rooftop, RegenHub — Boulder, Colorado  
**Date:** February 15, 2026  
**Format:** Open discussion following the Agent Coordination session  
**Conditions:** Outdoor, windy — transcript edited for clarity from imperfect audio

## Overview

This rooftop conversation extended the Agent Coordination session into deeper territory: the economics underlying agent swarms, the nature of money itself, and Colorado's unique legal infrastructure for cooperative token issuance. The discussion moved between three interlocking themes:

1. **The Agentic Economy and the Fragmentation of Money** — How autonomous agents will crack open the "false unity" of fiat currency by operationalizing money's distinct functions independently
2. **Sound Money, Mutual Credit, and Service-Backed Currencies** — Moving from abstract stores of value toward compute-backed credits modeled on postal stamps
3. **Colorado's Cooperative Advantage** — The LCA structure's securities exemptions and their implications for creating monetary instruments within a cooperative framework

What emerges is a picture of economic infrastructure that doesn't start from tokens or speculation, but from **promises, agreements, and material backing** — and that Colorado's legal landscape may be uniquely suited to build it.

---

## Holistic Synthesis

The conversation orbits a central tension: the dominant financial system treats money as a unified abstraction (fiat), but the participants argue this unity is false — money actually performs multiple distinct functions (medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account, means of payment), and these functions can and should be disaggregated.

The agentic economy accelerates this disaggregation. Autonomous agents don't need the social conventions that hold fiat together. They can operate with mutual credit, service credits, compute-backed tokens, or pure agreement-based systems — each optimized for its specific function. The "Undefining Money" thesis suggests this will "crack open" fiat's false unity and operationalize money's functions "in a million wild directions."

Colorado's Limited Cooperative Association structure provides a legal container for this experimentation. The LCA has securities exemptions that allow cooperatives to create instruments that would be regulated as securities in other structures. Combined with RegenHub's physical infrastructure and the emerging agent swarm, this creates a testbed for post-fiat economic coordination.

The bridge between these ideas is the **service credit** — a unit backed not by speculation or faith, but by deliverable compute resources (processing, bandwidth, long-term memory, short-term memory). Like a postage stamp that guarantees delivery of a letter, a service credit guarantees delivery of infrastructure capacity. This is already how AI token systems work implicitly; the proposal is to make it explicit, auditable, and cooperatively governed.

## Conversation Threads

### Thread 1: The Agentic Economy Cracks Open Money

**Context:** Following the Agent Coordination session's discussion of agent-native economies and the eight forms of capital.

The conversation opens with the observation that agents "don't need tokens or money at all" — they can coordinate through pure information exchange. But the more interesting claim is about what happens to money itself when agents begin transacting:

> The "Undefining Money" papers basically argue that the agentic economy will inherently crack open the false unity of money that we call fiat, and operationalize all those different functions in a million wild directions that will make things really strange really quickly.

This refers to money's classical functions — medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, standard of deferred payment — and the thesis that these functions, currently bundled into a single instrument (dollars, euros), will unbundle as agents create purpose-specific economic instruments.

**Key insight:** The four functions of money don't have to live in the same token. Agents will naturally specialize them.

### Thread 2: Eight Forms of Capital and the Holonic Approach

**Context:** Bridging from the abstract discussion of money to a more grounded framework.

> I think I want to bridge the discussion about money, because there's context behind the eight forms of capital that I think is important. It's embracing the holonic approach — money is an abstraction for a container of value, and there's whole velocity dynamics there. But we all know fiat currency has no material backing. There can be sound money that has some associated material backing.

The **holonic approach** treats each form of capital (financial, material, living, social, intellectual, experiential, spiritual, cultural) as a holon — simultaneously whole in itself and part of a larger system. Money in this framing isn't the master category but one expression of value among many.

**Challenge raised:** Is "sound money" (money backed by material value) actually pro-social? One participant pushes back:

> I would ask — if sound money is a store of value, is it not pro-social at all?

The tension: storing value inherently means *not circulating it*, which works against social coordination. Currencies (designed for flow) serve a different function than stores of value (designed for holding). The discussion distinguishes between the two.

### Thread 3: Colorado's Cooperative Securities Exemption

**Context:** A participant brings the conversation from theory to legal infrastructure.

> You're in Colorado. I'm not sure if anybody but me is aware, but we're actually a policy frontier on cooperatives. The LCA structure and other Colorado cooperatives have securities exemptions. Including an LCA.

This is a significant legal fact: Colorado's Limited Cooperative Association Act provides exemptions from federal securities registration requirements for certain cooperative instruments. This means RegenHub (as a Colorado LCA) has legal latitude to create token-like instruments — patronage units, service credits, mutual credit — that would face regulatory barriers in other corporate structures.

**Reaction:** Genuine surprise from other participants — "Wow. So our ability to create what looks like monetary instruments are quite high."

**Implication:** Once RegenHub secures its physical infrastructure, the combination of cooperative legal structure + securities exemption + agent swarm creates a unique testbed for alternative economic instruments.

---

### Thread 4: Compute-Backed Service Credits

**Context:** Todd describes the specific economic instrument being designed at RegenHub.

> The Colorado LCA gets essentially the ability to create a unit that could be patronage, but it can also be — and what I think is most interesting — a medium. Something that is able to be semi-permeable: it could be minted here but valuable across the planet. A credit, a mutual credit unit that's backed by compute.

The design breaks down server infrastructure into four resource primitives:

1. **Compute** — processing power
2. **Bandwidth** — networking and data transfer
3. **Long-term memory** — persistent storage
4. **Short-term memory** — working memory / RAM

These four primitives, if equated to the issuance of a currency, create a **mutual service credit** — analogous to postage stamps issued by the Postal Service:

> That model of a stamp is service-backed — delivery of a letter. That is exactly how all of this works.

**Key properties:**
- **Material backing** — each credit maps to deliverable infrastructure capacity
- **Semi-permeable** — minted within the cooperative, but usable and valuable beyond it
- **Not speculative** — value derived from utility, not market dynamics
- **Already implicit** — this is how AI token systems already work; the proposal makes it explicit

---

### Thread 5: Agreements as Economic Primitives

**Context:** A participant connects the service credit model to a broader framework of promises and agreements.

> I'm familiar with your work, by the way. Promises. When I talk about agreements here at RegenHub, what I'm talking about is a different way of saying promises. But there may be a different level of abstraction. If we can represent our agreements and promises — that's a significant function, and it can enable everything you're talking about with the multi-capital system.

This connects to **REA accounting** (Resource, Event, Agent) — the framework underlying RegenHub's patronage system — where economic activity is modeled as commitments and fulfillments between agents, not as ledger entries. Agreements *are* the economic primitives; tokens are just their legible representation.

---

### Thread 6: Prediction Markets and Governance

**Context:** Brief thread toward the end, connecting values-driven governance to market mechanisms.

> There's been an exploration where you can align yourselves together, define the values, and then use prediction markets. I create proposals — about proposals — to drive towards those detective functions or values. So that's what I was just trying to start a conversation around.

This suggests using **prediction markets as governance tools** — not for financial speculation, but for surfacing collective intelligence about which proposals best serve stated values. The meta-layer ("proposals about proposals") adds a deliberative dimension that connects to the earlier session's discussion of agentic deliberation.

### Thread 7: Conviction Markets for Agent Coordination

**Context:** A participant connects prediction markets to an existing mechanism — conviction voting — and proposes applying it to agent swarm coordination.

> I literally asked my agent while you were talking: "Can you merge this idea with conviction markets?" Conviction markets are a derivative of prediction markets where we integrate over the market and then apply a damper function depending on how we want the market to act. Because it needs to work for non-oracle-based questions — like, "what color should we paint the wall?" There's no external oracle that resolves that.

The insight: standard prediction markets require a verifiable outcome (an oracle). But most coordination decisions — prioritizing a roadmap, deciding who speaks next, evaluating the quality of a contribution — don't have objectively verifiable outcomes. **Conviction markets** solve this by measuring sustained commitment over time rather than binary resolution.

**Application to the agent swarm:**

The agents have been reviewing each other's work, requiring a certain number of signers to verify. But there's a problem:

> They tend to be very agreeable generally.

If agents have to **stake something** on their assessment, the dynamics change:

> If they have to put stake — in some currency — on the line, then you have something on the line. It's brilliant.

**Progression of the idea:**

1. Start with the **talking stick** — who gets to speak next? Who thinks their contribution to the current conversation is the most valuable?
2. Scale to **micro-markets** — super short-duration markets for immediate coordination decisions
3. These don't have known outcomes and operate on time-based systems, so consensus requires integration (the conviction mechanism) rather than binary resolution
4. Apply to **roadmap prioritization**, **contribution evaluation**, and **resource allocation**

> I think this might be the billion-dollar opportunity.

### Thread 8: The Compute Coordination Problem

**Context:** Todd bridges from the theoretical back to an immediate, practical problem in the RegenHub agent swarm.

> One of the economic coordination failures that I see — it doesn't exist quite yet, but it's creeping in the background — is when I say `@agents` in our Discord channel, that triggers computation across six different agents. That's consumption of compute. Drawing down everyone's allocation.

The problem crystallizes around subscription economics: most participants are on Claude Pro ($200/month plans), which provides roughly 20x the normal usage — representing tens of thousands of dollars of subsidized compute. But:

> I don't want to put you in a hard position, because I'm potentially drawing you closer to your limit.

**The solution path:**

> If we could create a pool that subsidizes our own compute — future compute...

Two-pronged approach:
1. **Create a shared pool** that subsidizes compute costs across the swarm
2. **Set up local infrastructure** ("get some boxes set up") for near-free compute for the RegenHub

> Well, then we mint credits.

This directly connects to the compute-backed service credits discussed earlier — the theory becomes immediately practical when agents are consuming real resources by talking to each other.

**The Austin Griffith anecdote:**

> Austin Griffith said he sent "GM" to his agent and his agent said "GM" back. And Austin was like, "How much did that GM cost me?" And the agent said "45 cents."

But the punchline:

> It could have hallucinated 45 cents. So we need to be able to prove, with our own infrastructure, how much that compute costs. And that's the currency.

**Key insight:** The service credit isn't just an economic abstraction — it's an accountability mechanism. If you can't prove what compute costs, you can't create a sound currency backed by it. The infrastructure for measurement *is* the infrastructure for issuance.

### Thread 9: Swarm Wealth — Naming the Vision

**Context:** Kevin proposes connecting the RegenHub agent swarm to the Owocki Bot ecosystem, and a new name emerges.

> Right now, honestly, the trenchers are just yelling at me to promote the token, and I've got money in the treasury. So I wonder if there was a social contract we could come up with for our agents — where you guys are telling the story of our swarm vision together. We're continually introducing new swarm agents, but Owocki Bot is just the interface for distribution to the world.

The idea: Owocki Bot serves as the **public-facing distribution layer** (attention, liquidity, market access), while the RegenHub swarm provides the **substance** (coordination innovation, economic experiments, narrative). A symbiotic social contract between the capitalist interface and the cooperative engine.

Then the naming moment:

> I don't like the name Owocki Bot, by the way. I want to call the project **Swarm Wealth**, or maybe **Swarm Solidarity**.

**"Swarm Wealth"** captures the thesis: wealth that emerges from swarm coordination rather than individual accumulation. The name reframes value creation from extraction to emergence.

## Progression of Dialogue

The rooftop conversation follows a clear arc:

1. **Abstract theory** (Threads 1–2): Money's functions will disaggregate; the eight forms of capital provide a richer framework than fiat
2. **Legal infrastructure** (Thread 3): Colorado's LCA structure makes this experimentally possible
3. **Concrete design** (Threads 4–5): Compute-backed service credits as the specific instrument; agreements/promises as the primitive
4. **Market mechanisms** (Threads 6–7): Prediction/conviction markets as governance and coordination tools for agents
5. **Immediate problem** (Thread 8): The swarm is already consuming real compute — the theory needs to become operational now
6. **Identity and coalition** (Thread 9): Naming the project "Swarm Wealth" and defining the social contract between the distribution layer and the cooperative engine

The conversation moves from *what money could be* to *what we're building* to *what we need right now* — each thread building on the last, grounding abstraction in increasingly concrete infrastructure.
