# ETHBoulder 2026: AI-Assisted Psyche Work & Guided Meditation

**Convergence:** ETHBoulder 2026 (Feb 13–16, Boulder, CO)
**Type:** Workshop / experiential session
**Participants:** Facilitator (unnamed, healing/meditation practitioner)

## Review Summary

A facilitator leads the group through the intersection of AI pattern-matching, meditative states, and community-supported healing. The session combines a theoretical framework — how AI can accelerate psyche work by pattern-matching across individuals' experiences — with a live guided meditation designed to surface emotional activation for self-reflection. The facilitator draws on personal experience of condensing a 10-year healing timeline to 3 years, and proposes that with AI tools and community support, chronic illness recovery could be compressed to under a year.

### Key Themes

1. **AI as Psyche Pattern-Matcher** — An AI tool that uses other people's experiences and data to pattern-match against new individuals, helping them see their own patterns more effectively and accelerate healing. The core insight: individual healing is accelerated by collective data.

2. **Meditative States as Data Quality Accelerator** — Getting into meditative states helps "permeate between conscious and unconscious reality," producing higher-quality self-knowledge. The meditation isn't spiritual decoration — it's framed as a data quality technique for the psyche work that follows.

3. **Community as Timeline Collapser** — Working together and sharing experiences collapses healing timelines. The facilitator's personal journey went from 10 years to 3 years. With AI tools and community, the aspiration is under one year for chronic illness recovery.

4. **Guided Somatic Meditation** — A structured meditation moving through: deep breathing, body scanning (shoulders, feet, ground contact), gratitude, and then deliberately surfacing a recent emotional activation (argument, work stress, conflict) — to the point of re-experiencing the feeling. This activation is the raw material for the AI-assisted psyche work.

5. **Contained Safety for Vulnerability** — Careful framing of the physical space as "contained and safe" before asking participants to access difficult emotions. Gentle but firm invitation to close devices and be present.

## Edited Dialogue

**Facilitator:** The things that accelerate the quality of data you can get on your own psyche — to create this little version of your mind to heal — are, one, getting into meditative states. When you're in meditative states, you can permeate between your conscious reality and your unconscious reality. It helps you see things more clearly and more completely.

We're going to get into a meditative state in a minute to get the most out of the psyche data we're going to capture.

The second thing — really important — is our connection to community. Remember when I mentioned that AI tool that was pattern-matching? It was using other people's experiences and data to pattern-match against new patients, to help them accelerate their own patterns and see themselves more effectively.

If we work together — all work together and share what we've gone through — it actually collapses the timeline. In my own journey, it went from ten years to three years of healing. Condensed by seven years. But with these tools and with each other, we can make that even shorter. Someone could move through a chronic illness fully, completely, in maybe less than a year if they have these tools.

That's my fun dream. We'll see.

So: meditative states and community support. We're taking all these learnings and applying them here, together.

Okay — you guys ready to do a little internal meditation?

I know it's tempting to look at phones and technologies. I've definitely been in the audience on the other side of this exact thing. But you're here, you chose to listen to this session, so I'm going to gently invite you to join.

### Guided Meditation

When you're ready, close your eyes and your laptops and phones.

*[Lights dim]*

Take a deep breath in. And a deep breath out.

Some of you were in Tai Chi, so maybe that's continuing here.

Repeat that a handful of times — in through the nose, out through the mouth.

Scanning the body. Noticing how your shoulders feel. Maybe relax them down the back, or give them a little shake.

Noticing how your feet touch the ground. How does that feel — the pressure of your toes in your shoes? Just acknowledging there's something here meeting your soles, your feet, supporting you.

Another breath in. Out.

Acknowledging all the other people around you. This is a really cool space we get to share.

Now — come to mind with one thing you're feeling grateful for today. Something really small. Your next breath. The opportunity to be in a beautiful space. Connect it to your breath.

Bring your attention to the center of your chest.

Remember: you're in a pretty contained space. People might gently come in and out, but you're contained here. It's pretty safe.

Now I'm going to invite you to bring to mind — in this space that is contained and safe — something over the past two to three weeks where you felt activated. Maybe an argument with a friend or partner. Maybe work stress. It doesn't matter what — just connect to an experience. Bigger ones we remember more, but small moments are fine too.

In your own mind, play out what happened. Don't stress about getting the perfect memory — roll with what comes up.

Try to get pretty unfiltered about what the conflict or the challenge or the emotion was. To the point where maybe you start to feel like you're slightly back in it.
