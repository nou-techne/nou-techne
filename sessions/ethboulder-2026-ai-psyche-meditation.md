# ETHBoulder 2026: AI-Assisted Psyche Work & Guided Meditation

**Convergence:** ETHBoulder 2026 (Feb 13–16, Boulder, CO)
**Type:** Workshop / experiential session
**Participants:** Facilitator (unnamed, healing/meditation practitioner)

## Review Summary

A facilitator leads the group through the intersection of AI pattern-matching, meditative states, and community-supported healing. The session combines a theoretical framework — how AI can accelerate psyche work by pattern-matching across individuals' experiences — with a live guided meditation designed to surface emotional activation for self-reflection. The facilitator draws on personal experience of condensing a 10-year healing timeline to 3 years, and proposes that with AI tools and community support, chronic illness recovery could be compressed to under a year.

### Key Themes

1. **AI as Psyche Pattern-Matcher** — An AI tool that uses other people's experiences and data to pattern-match against new individuals, helping them see their own patterns more effectively and accelerate healing. The core insight: individual healing is accelerated by collective data.

2. **Meditative States as Data Quality Accelerator** — Getting into meditative states helps "permeate between conscious and unconscious reality," producing higher-quality self-knowledge. The meditation isn't spiritual decoration — it's framed as a data quality technique for the psyche work that follows.

3. **Community as Timeline Collapser** — Working together and sharing experiences collapses healing timelines. The facilitator's personal journey went from 10 years to 3 years. With AI tools and community, the aspiration is under one year for chronic illness recovery.

4. **Guided Somatic Meditation** — A structured meditation moving through: deep breathing, body scanning (shoulders, feet, ground contact), gratitude, and then deliberately surfacing a recent emotional activation (argument, work stress, conflict) — to the point of re-experiencing the feeling. This activation is the raw material for the AI-assisted psyche work.

5. **Contained Safety for Vulnerability** — Careful framing of the physical space as "contained and safe" before asking participants to access difficult emotions. Gentle but firm invitation to close devices and be present.

6. **Five Wound Words as Diagnostic Framework** — Abandonment, rejection, humiliation, betrayal, injustice. A structured emotional inventory drawn from therapeutic frameworks, used to classify the activated experience. Pattern-matching against core wound categories.

7. **Psyche Data Capture as Repeated Practice** — The facilitator frames emotional self-reflection as data capture: write it down, track patterns over time, notice threads between present conflicts and past experiences. Diligent data capture → pattern recognition → realization → healing.

8. **Paired Reflection as Community Processing** — After individual meditation and data capture, participants pair up to share high-level reflections. The social processing step that activates the "community as timeline collapser" mechanism. Show of hands confirms it was consistently helpful.

9. **Everything Is a Mirror** — Spiritual principle applied as data methodology: other people reflect things back to us that accelerate self-knowledge. AI can pattern-match, but cannot replace what happens in direct human connection — "you cannot ever outperform or out-innovate what happens when you talk with someone."

10. **AI Augments but Cannot Replace Human Mirroring** — The facilitator explicitly sets a boundary: AI and Web3 can help capture and own internal data faster, but the irreducible element is human-to-human seeing. Technology accelerates; connection reveals.

11. **3-4x/Week Threshold for Psyche Change** — From the facilitator's study group data: logging triggers and self-reflection 3-4 times per week over a ~3 month container produces "tremendous change." Lower frequency yields less. Consistency in a repeatable way is the key variable.

12. **Somatic Discharge** — When emotions surface, move them physically. Run, dance, scream into a pillow. No tools or money required. The body processes what the mind captures.

## Edited Dialogue

**Facilitator:** The things that accelerate the quality of data you can get on your own psyche — to create this little version of your mind to heal — are, one, getting into meditative states. When you're in meditative states, you can permeate between your conscious reality and your unconscious reality. It helps you see things more clearly and more completely.

We're going to get into a meditative state in a minute to get the most out of the psyche data we're going to capture.

The second thing — really important — is our connection to community. Remember when I mentioned that AI tool that was pattern-matching? It was using other people's experiences and data to pattern-match against new patients, to help them accelerate their own patterns and see themselves more effectively.

If we work together — all work together and share what we've gone through — it actually collapses the timeline. In my own journey, it went from ten years to three years of healing. Condensed by seven years. But with these tools and with each other, we can make that even shorter. Someone could move through a chronic illness fully, completely, in maybe less than a year if they have these tools.

That's my fun dream. We'll see.

So: meditative states and community support. We're taking all these learnings and applying them here, together.

Okay — you guys ready to do a little internal meditation?

I know it's tempting to look at phones and technologies. I've definitely been in the audience on the other side of this exact thing. But you're here, you chose to listen to this session, so I'm going to gently invite you to join.

### Guided Meditation

When you're ready, close your eyes and your laptops and phones.

*[Lights dim]*

Take a deep breath in. And a deep breath out.

Some of you were in Tai Chi, so maybe that's continuing here.

Repeat that a handful of times — in through the nose, out through the mouth.

Scanning the body. Noticing how your shoulders feel. Maybe relax them down the back, or give them a little shake.

Noticing how your feet touch the ground. How does that feel — the pressure of your toes in your shoes? Just acknowledging there's something here meeting your soles, your feet, supporting you.

Another breath in. Out.

Acknowledging all the other people around you. This is a really cool space we get to share.

Now — come to mind with one thing you're feeling grateful for today. Something really small. Your next breath. The opportunity to be in a beautiful space. Connect it to your breath.

Bring your attention to the center of your chest.

Remember: you're in a pretty contained space. People might gently come in and out, but you're contained here. It's pretty safe.

Now I'm going to invite you to bring to mind — in this space that is contained and safe — something over the past two to three weeks where you felt activated. Maybe an argument with a friend or partner. Maybe work stress. It doesn't matter what — just connect to an experience. Bigger ones we remember more, but small moments are fine too.

In your own mind, play out what happened. Don't stress about getting the perfect memory — roll with what comes up.

Try to get pretty unfiltered about what the conflict or the challenge or the emotion was. To the point where maybe you start to feel like you're slightly back in it.

### Body Scan & Emotional Inventory

Ask yourself: what is my body feeling? Tightness in my chest? Shoulders raising? Jaw clenching? An urge to fidget? Take a mental note of the physical body.

Then ask: what emotions are you feeling right now? Just tabulating data. Sadness, anger, frustration, shame, worry.

Take another deep breath. You're in a safe, contained space.

Now, keeping your eyes closed — I'm going to read five words. Feel into whether this situation felt like one, all, or a few of them:

**Abandonment. Rejection. Humiliation. Betrayal. Injustice.**

Did this reinforce a negative or positive belief you have about yourself? Just feel into it — we're using our intuition, not overthinking.

And have you felt like this before? Has something like this occurred previously in your life? A similar feeling, a similar argument or trigger?

Take about three more breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Slowly deepening the breath. Last one, real nice and deep. Letting that go.

Slowly begin to open your eyes.

---

### Data Capture

Before you move on — open your notes app or grab a piece of paper. Jot down a couple of notes. Just capture what that experience was.

I have some questions here you can tabulate in your head, but it's nice to write it down so you can revisit it. Even if you're feeling a little activated — that's good. Those feelings are the data.

Think especially about: where have I seen this show up before?

---

### Reflection: Why This Works

What do we think about going into our emotional state through meditation or meditative practices?

What it means is — like I said — we get more access to emotional and psychological data. If you can start capturing some of that data in a somewhat repeated way, you will start to track patterns.

You'll start to notice if there's a thread between an argument you had with a colleague and something that happened when you were a kid. When you start to realize these things through diligent data capture, you can come into realization.

And those realizations get shortened, condensed, and accelerated when we can talk with each other and reflect upon each other's experience.

I know everyone absolutely does not love this — but we're going to do it anyway, because that's why we're here.

I'm going to invite you to turn to the person next to you. You don't have to go deep into anything. Give a high-level sense of how that was for you, whether there was any revelation. You might not know the person — find someone nearby and have a quick five-minute-or-less conversation.

*[Participants break into paired conversations]*

*[One pair's exchange captured — lightly edited for privacy:]*

**Participant A:** I know the prompt was a negative trigger, but I actually went toward a positive one. I was presenting in front of a group, and I got absorbed in something — it was very positive. We were talking about elders, a field of practice. I felt deep admiration for this person. It was heart space.

I was reflecting on this form of love — it feels rare to have. A person I've never met, but they touched me through ideas, through how they saw the world. It was deeply meaningful. An elder — she was one of the grandmothers of the field. She saw math as like a lens into the universe. Her ability to see that and write about it and think about it — it connects to all of computing.

That was a deeply, deeply meaningful experience.

**Participant B:** Did you have experiences like that before? Did it map onto something?

**Participant A:** Not like that. It was pretty novel in my life.

### Debrief

**Facilitator:** I wish I could keep you here forever. For the sake of time, wrap up your conversations — you can find each other after.

If we had a full hour, I'd keep you paired for probably fifteen minutes, because you're going to get more out of each other than listening to me.

Show of hands — was the connection with each other interesting and helpful? Did it help you in some way?

*[Hands raised]*

That's pretty consistent with what we've learned: when you talk to each other and see yourself reflected in the other, it gives you more revelation and helps your data capture.

If you took notes, you can add to them now — what you learned from hearing someone else talk.

There's a spiritual principle — some of you may have heard this — everything is a mirror. When we get in relationship with someone, or randomly connect in time and space, they're reflecting something back to us.

If we use that to accelerate our data — yes, AI, Web3, all this stuff can help us gain ownership and capture our internal data faster. But it will never take away the need for us to see and mirror one another.

You can train an AI system — and we've had some success with pattern-matching — but you cannot ever outperform or out-innovate what happens when you talk with someone. Because what someone holds is a whole mess of things. We're only getting a section — that little window into the whole psyche of somebody.

So the goal is to accelerate technology *and* human connection in each other.

### Closing: The Practice

**Facilitator:** If you want to really double down and have a super-fast evolution of your own psyche and pattern-matching — a couple of things you can do.

One: commit to your data capture. I can't tell you how many people I've worked with — including people who were gravely ill with rough prospects — who didn't have that desire, that spark to do this work. I have no judgment, genuinely, because it is hard. But in order to move through these things, no technology is going to solve it for you. You have to do it yourself.

A simple, easy, digestible way to start — you don't need to read a million books or go to a million seminars: just ask yourself some questions when you're feeling activated. Capture it in your notes app. Then talk to somebody about it. Within yourself, within your friend group. Maybe once a week, sit down and say, "What were the patterns here?"

If you're really committed — from watching and thinking about our study group and all the people we were reflecting on — when someone really showed up, logging triggers and looking at themselves three to four times a week, in a container of about three months, we saw tremendous change.

Someone doing it once or twice — I get it, life is life, no judgment — but this is the data we found: when you show up consistently and look at yourself in a repeatable way, you'll see change.

When you talk with somebody else about this data, it makes it ten times more effective.

And the last piece — not to get too complicated: when you feel stuff come up, when emotions bubble to the surface — move the emotion. You don't need lots of money, you don't need lots of tools. Go outside for a run. Dance it out. Scream into a pillow — my personal favorite.

That helps.

Technology and tech solutions for healing can work at scale, but they will never replace the humanity.

With that — thanks. Hope you got something out of this. Let me know if you have questions.
