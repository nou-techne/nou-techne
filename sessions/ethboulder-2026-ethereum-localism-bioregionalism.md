## Review Summary

Sarah and Benjamin open a session on Ethereum localism by tracing the movement's origins from the General Forum of Ethereum Localism (GFEL) in Portland through to ETHBoulder, and articulating the core values and productive contradictions at the heart of the movement. The session establishes Ethereum localism as occupying the tension between global protocol and place-based community — neither purely local nor abstractly global, but bridging both.

### Key Themes

1. **GFEL Origins and Community Formation** — The General Forum of Ethereum Localism (GFEL), held twice in Portland and then in Boulder, catalyzed the movement. It brought together a "crypto-leftist" and explicitly values-aligned subset of the Web3 community. By giving the movement a name and a space, it helped people find each other. The Portland events are where Benjamin first met Kevin Owocki, despite both living in Boulder. Deep relationships and solidarity have formed from this core group.

2. **The Productive Contradiction** — Ethereum localism sits at the center of a fundamental tension: a global protocol versus lived, place-based realities. The movement refuses to resolve this tension in either direction — it's neither "hyper-local only, screw the global commons" nor "abstracted global coordination that doesn't connect to real everyday lives." Instead, it holds both simultaneously.

3. **Core Values** — Democratic participation, community ownership, cooperativism, peer-to-peer technological architectures that prevent capture by centralized institutions. The combination of sovereignty and care. Global solidarity applied through place-based communities where communities define how technology is used and deployed.

4. **The Bridge Problem** — The central challenge: Ethereum provides a global ledger for coordinating around open source software and public goods, but where is the bridge that makes it relevant for local communities? Until the technology "touches down" in actual places, the values remain aspirational.

5. **Institutional Context** — Multiple overlapping organizations and initiatives:
   - **Open Civics** — A DAO co-founded by Benjamin
   - **Localism Fund** — Ethereum-aligned project funding local public goods
   - **Spirit of the Front Range** — Bioregional nonprofit in Colorado
   - **GFEL** — The catalyzing event series
   - **Gitcoin** — Also credited with helping the community find each other

6. **Cosmo-Local Principle** — "What is light should be global and shared; what is heavy should be local and self-governed." Knowledge and protocols are shared openly; application and stewardship remain local. The third path between global abstraction and local isolation.

7. **The Vibe Shift and Consolidation** — The free money era is over. Layer 2 marketing budgets won't fund the revolution. The industry is consolidating. This creates both risk (capture by BlackRock, stablecoin legislation tying to USD) and opportunity (forced coalition-building, pooling into shared open source projects). The system "metabolizes its own critique" through institutional capture.

8. **Bulwark Against Authoritarian Protocolization** — DIAC and Ethereum localism as cultural hedges against centralized actors who see how protocolized society could circumvent their power. The political stakes of decentralization are becoming explicit.

9. **From Dependency to Self-Created Economies** — The movement was parasitic on VC-inflated infrastructure. Now it must build genuine alternative economies — scrappier, coalition-based, commons-oriented. The consolidation forces the maturation that free money prevented.

## Edited Dialogue

**Sarah:** It's really exciting to be here. Let's start out with introductions. I'm Sarah Johnstone. I'm a permaculturist, a bioregionalist, and an active Ethereum member. I'm really passionate about the Ethereum localism community, and I'm excited to be here with Benjamin.

**Benjamin:** Hi, everyone. My name is Benjamin Life. I'm a co-founder of a DAO called Open Civics, and also a co-steward of the Localism Fund, which is an Ethereum-aligned project funding local public goods — we'll talk more about that later. And most recently, a co-founder and steward of the Spirit of the Front Range, which is a bioregional nonprofit here in Colorado.

**Sarah:** I'd love to fill in some context for those attending this event for the first time. Obviously this is the first ETHBoulder, but we had an event last year called the General Forum of Ethereum Localism — GFEL — which I like to think seeded this bigger event we're having now.

Benjamin, can you share some context about that event, where the movement was born in Portland, your experience, and what we're doing here?

**Benjamin:** It's really beautiful to have some of the catalysts of GFEL and the Ethereum localism movement here in the house. I want to shout out Christy, Exhumed, and a few other members of their crew.

Out in Portland, they brought a group of us together for the first time. It was actually where I first met Kevin Owocki, even though we both lived in Boulder. It catalyzed a tremendous amount and set a precedent for what the Ethereum localism community is and what the shared values are.

It really brought together a kind of crypto-leftist, but also a more explicitly values-aligned subset of the Web3 community. By giving it a name and a space, it helped a lot of us find each other. Gitcoin has also done this, but I think the GFEL events — twice in Portland and then here in Boulder — really established this core group of us who have developed deep relationships and solidarity.

**Sarah:** Can you speak to some of those values we hold in the ecosystem?

**Benjamin:** It's hard to talk about the values without first acknowledging the underlying contradiction within Ethereum localism — this tension between a global protocol and the lived realities that each of us are actually embedded in, in specific places.

We have this global ledger that allows us to coordinate and support open source software and public goods. But where is the bridge that actually makes that relevant for local communities? Because until it touches down, I think what a lot of us who got into the space for — the values of democratic participation, community ownership, cooperativism, peer-to-peer technological architectures that prevent capture by centralized institutions — this idea of combining sovereignty and care. I think those are at the core of it for me.

This is inherent to Ethereum, and why I think Ethereum is a place where these values are at home. There is this global solidarity, and then the need to apply those technologies in place-based communities where communities have the sovereignty to define how the technology is used and deployed.

Ethereum localism sits in the center of that contradiction. Instead of saying it's one or the other — it's not hyper-local only, "buy local and screw you to the global commons," nor is it trying to create an abstracted global coordination layer that doesn't meaningfully connect to people's real everyday lives.

**Benjamin:** So by navigating that tension, we look for where we can be in global solidarity. This has to do with the cosmo-local movement as well — this idea that what is light should be global and shared, and what is heavy should be local and self-governed.

We're navigating those tensions by creating a third thing that is open source. We're sharing knowledge freely, combining our knowledge and protocols and open source software. But then making sure that local self-determination and community-led initiatives are stewarding how those protocols are applied at the local level.

**Sarah:** Last year we gathered a couple hundred people for two days. It was very dynamic, lively, participatory. There was some really exciting movement that happened immediately — ETH Denver and the formation of the RegenHub Commons Group.

We have a four-hour track tomorrow — Ethereum Localism at Riverside. How do you think we're doing? How do you think we're navigating these tensions? I know you've had a major milestone with the Localism Fund.

**Benjamin:** To hearken back to Kevin's opening this morning — I feel that "we're so back" / "it's so over" dialectic inside myself on a moment-to-moment basis.

I'll start with why I'm pessimistic, then go into why I'm optimistic.

I sense a vibe shift in the industry at large. There's a sense that the free money machine — at the early stage, a lot of us with pro-social values thought, "If we just hang out close to this money-printing factory, we can change the world." That money-printing factory has dried up. The marketing budgets of Layer 2s are no longer going to fund the revolution. I'm letting you know. There was a brief moment where I thought they would. But they won't.

There's a consolidation in the market. The stablecoin success, the deregulation around Trump — these create both an opportunity and a risk for our space.

I think DIAC — decentralized accelerationism — and Ethereum localism are cultural nodes within the blockchain space attempting to be a bulwark, a hedge against the rise of more authoritarian aspects of our society. Those actors have probably seen the long game of how a protocolized society would circumvent their access to power — centralization is necessary for them to maintain their systemic position.

It makes sense that BlackRock is getting involved. It makes sense that we're writing legislation connecting stablecoin issuance to the U.S. dollar. That's how the system tries to metabolize its own critique.

Those of us who got into this industry for other reasons — the pro-social aspects, the democratic aspects, the economic transformations — it's very important for us to stay together.

In that consolidation: maybe there's not enough space in the industry for all of us to be doing our own thing the way there was when there was a lot of money. So finding coalitions, finding commons, finding open source projects we can pool into together — I think that's the positive aspect of the consolidation.

There's not as much free money. So we actually have to get scrappier about creating our own economies. In some ways, we were still dependent on infrastructure being inflated by institutional investors coming into the space. That was never going to be sustainable. It was never going to be the alternative parallel society economy that I think a lot of us want to create.
