## Review Summary

Sarah and Benjamin open a session on Ethereum localism by tracing the movement's origins from the General Forum of Ethereum Localism (GFEL) in Portland through to ETHBoulder, and articulating the core values and productive contradictions at the heart of the movement. The session establishes Ethereum localism as occupying the tension between global protocol and place-based community — neither purely local nor abstractly global, but bridging both.

### Key Themes

1. **GFEL Origins and Community Formation** — The General Forum of Ethereum Localism (GFEL), held twice in Portland and then in Boulder, catalyzed the movement. It brought together a "crypto-leftist" and explicitly values-aligned subset of the Web3 community. By giving the movement a name and a space, it helped people find each other. The Portland events are where Benjamin first met Kevin Owocki, despite both living in Boulder. Deep relationships and solidarity have formed from this core group.

2. **The Productive Contradiction** — Ethereum localism sits at the center of a fundamental tension: a global protocol versus lived, place-based realities. The movement refuses to resolve this tension in either direction — it's neither "hyper-local only, screw the global commons" nor "abstracted global coordination that doesn't connect to real everyday lives." Instead, it holds both simultaneously.

3. **Core Values** — Democratic participation, community ownership, cooperativism, peer-to-peer technological architectures that prevent capture by centralized institutions. The combination of sovereignty and care. Global solidarity applied through place-based communities where communities define how technology is used and deployed.

4. **The Bridge Problem** — The central challenge: Ethereum provides a global ledger for coordinating around open source software and public goods, but where is the bridge that makes it relevant for local communities? Until the technology "touches down" in actual places, the values remain aspirational.

5. **Institutional Context** — Multiple overlapping organizations and initiatives:
   - **Open Civics** — A DAO co-founded by Benjamin
   - **Localism Fund** — Ethereum-aligned project funding local public goods
   - **Spirit of the Front Range** — Bioregional nonprofit in Colorado
   - **GFEL** — The catalyzing event series
   - **Gitcoin** — Also credited with helping the community find each other

6. **Cosmo-Local Principle** — "What is light should be global and shared; what is heavy should be local and self-governed." Knowledge and protocols are shared openly; application and stewardship remain local. The third path between global abstraction and local isolation.

7. **The Vibe Shift and Consolidation** — The free money era is over. Layer 2 marketing budgets won't fund the revolution. The industry is consolidating. This creates both risk (capture by BlackRock, stablecoin legislation tying to USD) and opportunity (forced coalition-building, pooling into shared open source projects). The system "metabolizes its own critique" through institutional capture.

8. **Bulwark Against Authoritarian Protocolization** — DIAC and Ethereum localism as cultural hedges against centralized actors who see how protocolized society could circumvent their power. The political stakes of decentralization are becoming explicit.

9. **From Dependency to Self-Created Economies** — The movement was parasitic on VC-inflated infrastructure. Now it must build genuine alternative economies — scrappier, coalition-based, commons-oriented. The consolidation forces the maturation that free money prevented.

10. **$150K Localism Fund Distribution** — Twelve local funding programs across almost every continent receiving capital to experiment with diverse mechanisms. Real on-the-ground examples: solar crypto mining in Nigeria, cooperative businesses in Barcelona, UBI hubs in Colombia. RegenHub in Boulder as an LCA experiment.

11. **Trust Graph for Decentralized Evaluation** — Ethereum Attestation Service schema + PageRank-style algorithm. 100+ people, 1000 attestations, derived 30 most trusted evaluators who scored local funding programs. Matching ratios determined by collective network intelligence rather than centralized committee.

12. **Extitutional Logic** — Where institutions enclose, extitutions are about the relational web of networks. Optimizing for collective intelligence embedded in networks rather than enclosed in organizational boundaries.

13. **Protocol Underground** — Open Machine's concept: underground subcultures (psychedelic movement, sex-positive movement, community technology, art, spirituality) all practice protocolization as a social technology. "Set and setting" as an example of a non-deterministic, word-of-mouth protocol. The Ethereum community challenged to recognize these non-digital protocols as core to its values.

14. **City Repair and Pattern Forking** — Grassroots direct action that creates forkable patterns: community solves local problem (dangerous intersection), creates replicable protocol, other communities adapt it. Open protocols enable this commons of practical knowledge.

15. **Functional Pluralism** — Instead of binary governance decisions (fork or disband), embrace plural decisions proportional to interest. Credible neutrality through mechanism design.

16. **Subsidiarity** — Decision-making nested at the most local level where it has impact. Localism Fund funds grants programs, not projects — distributing agency, not passing the buck.

17. **Community Currency as Highest-Leverage Opportunity** — The most important and underdeveloped aspect of Ethereum localism. Need: easy token issuance, governance, point-of-sale, business onboarding. Traditional community currency knowledge (coupons, not money) meets blockchain rails. No one driving it forward adequately.

18. **Pluralism as Ethereum's Core Value** — Ethereum isn't one way to organize society; it's the belief that we all have a right to consent to how society is organized. A neutral substrate that enables plural experiments.

19. **Bioregional Citizenship** — Citizenship conferred by peers as recognition of responsibility and care, not by the state. We wear many hats: citizen of movement, bioregion, family, server. Global duties and local embeddedness simultaneously.

## Edited Dialogue

**Sarah:** It's really exciting to be here. Let's start out with introductions. I'm Sarah Johnstone. I'm a permaculturist, a bioregionalist, and an active Ethereum member. I'm really passionate about the Ethereum localism community, and I'm excited to be here with Benjamin.

**Benjamin:** Hi, everyone. My name is Benjamin Life. I'm a co-founder of a DAO called Open Civics, and also a co-steward of the Localism Fund, which is an Ethereum-aligned project funding local public goods — we'll talk more about that later. And most recently, a co-founder and steward of the Spirit of the Front Range, which is a bioregional nonprofit here in Colorado.

**Sarah:** I'd love to fill in some context for those attending this event for the first time. Obviously this is the first ETHBoulder, but we had an event last year called the General Forum of Ethereum Localism — GFEL — which I like to think seeded this bigger event we're having now.

Benjamin, can you share some context about that event, where the movement was born in Portland, your experience, and what we're doing here?

**Benjamin:** It's really beautiful to have some of the catalysts of GFEL and the Ethereum localism movement here in the house. I want to shout out Christy, Exhumed, and a few other members of their crew.

Out in Portland, they brought a group of us together for the first time. It was actually where I first met Kevin Owocki, even though we both lived in Boulder. It catalyzed a tremendous amount and set a precedent for what the Ethereum localism community is and what the shared values are.

It really brought together a kind of crypto-leftist, but also a more explicitly values-aligned subset of the Web3 community. By giving it a name and a space, it helped a lot of us find each other. Gitcoin has also done this, but I think the GFEL events — twice in Portland and then here in Boulder — really established this core group of us who have developed deep relationships and solidarity.

**Sarah:** Can you speak to some of those values we hold in the ecosystem?

**Benjamin:** It's hard to talk about the values without first acknowledging the underlying contradiction within Ethereum localism — this tension between a global protocol and the lived realities that each of us are actually embedded in, in specific places.

We have this global ledger that allows us to coordinate and support open source software and public goods. But where is the bridge that actually makes that relevant for local communities? Because until it touches down, I think what a lot of us who got into the space for — the values of democratic participation, community ownership, cooperativism, peer-to-peer technological architectures that prevent capture by centralized institutions — this idea of combining sovereignty and care. I think those are at the core of it for me.

This is inherent to Ethereum, and why I think Ethereum is a place where these values are at home. There is this global solidarity, and then the need to apply those technologies in place-based communities where communities have the sovereignty to define how the technology is used and deployed.

Ethereum localism sits in the center of that contradiction. Instead of saying it's one or the other — it's not hyper-local only, "buy local and screw you to the global commons," nor is it trying to create an abstracted global coordination layer that doesn't meaningfully connect to people's real everyday lives.

---

**Benjamin:** So by navigating that tension, we look for where we can be in global solidarity. This has to do with the cosmo-local movement as well — this idea that what is light should be global and shared, and what is heavy should be local and self-governed.

We're navigating those tensions by creating a third thing that is open source. We're sharing knowledge freely, combining our knowledge and protocols and open source software. But then making sure that local self-determination and community-led initiatives are stewarding how those protocols are applied at the local level.

**Sarah:** Last year we gathered a couple hundred people for two days. It was very dynamic, lively, participatory. There was some really exciting movement that happened immediately — ETH Denver and the formation of the RegenHub Commons Group.

We have a four-hour track tomorrow — Ethereum Localism at Riverside. How do you think we're doing? How do you think we're navigating these tensions? I know you've had a major milestone with the Localism Fund.

**Benjamin:** To hearken back to Kevin's opening this morning — I feel that "we're so back" / "it's so over" dialectic inside myself on a moment-to-moment basis.

I'll start with why I'm pessimistic, then go into why I'm optimistic.

I sense a vibe shift in the industry at large. There's a sense that the free money machine — at the early stage, a lot of us with pro-social values thought, "If we just hang out close to this money-printing factory, we can change the world." That money-printing factory has dried up. The marketing budgets of Layer 2s are no longer going to fund the revolution. I'm letting you know. There was a brief moment where I thought they would. But they won't.

There's a consolidation in the market. The stablecoin success, the deregulation around Trump — these create both an opportunity and a risk for our space.

I think DIAC — decentralized accelerationism — and Ethereum localism are cultural nodes within the blockchain space attempting to be a bulwark, a hedge against the rise of more authoritarian aspects of our society. Those actors have probably seen the long game of how a protocolized society would circumvent their access to power — centralization is necessary for them to maintain their systemic position.

It makes sense that BlackRock is getting involved. It makes sense that we're writing legislation connecting stablecoin issuance to the U.S. dollar. That's how the system tries to metabolize its own critique.

Those of us who got into this industry for other reasons — the pro-social aspects, the democratic aspects, the economic transformations — it's very important for us to stay together.

In that consolidation: maybe there's not enough space in the industry for all of us to be doing our own thing the way there was when there was a lot of money. So finding coalitions, finding commons, finding open source projects we can pool into together — I think that's the positive aspect of the consolidation.

There's not as much free money. So we actually have to get scrappier about creating our own economies. In some ways, we were still dependent on infrastructure being inflated by institutional investors coming into the space. That was never going to be sustainable. It was never going to be the alternative parallel society economy that I think a lot of us want to create.

---

**Benjamin:** In that consolidation, the opportunity is for us to get tighter in terms of the values-aligned portion of this industry, make a stronger claim of what those values are, and work more closely together.

On the positive side — we just distributed $150,000 to twelve different local funding programs, all experimenting with diverse mechanisms. That's thanks to Gitcoin and "sell the public goods."

Those stories are really exciting. We have real on-the-ground communities on almost every continent:

- A **solar crypto mining facility in Nigeria** funding education to give people workplace skills, with a totally self-sustaining revenue model
- A **network of cooperative businesses in Barcelona** creating a whole parallel economy and currency system
- Folks in **Colombia** doing really amazing UBI, creating community hubs distributing money to people living under the poverty line

And here in Boulder — Boulder was not part of the Localism Fund round. But we are experimenting with bioregional financing facilities and creating the **RegenHub as a limited cooperative association** — a community venture studio that's cooperatively owned, hopefully a catalyst for local economic development and community ownership.

All of these experiments are still very nascent. But the cool thing about running a program with twelve grants programs spread around the world, all exploring different methodologies: as they deploy capital, we get that cosmo-local learning loop. All the local experiments push insights back into the global community. If we run that process well, we'll get strategically better at allocating capital — not just to causes we think are important, but into the feedback loops that actually support creating parallel economies that let people exit capitalism to something else.

**Sarah:** I'd love for you to speak about the process of allocating that capital — the transparency and openness of how you collectively went about it.

**Benjamin:** When Gitcoin announced we were looking to fund domains, I immediately started thinking about the governance and coordination problem: how do you bring together the experts of a particular domain in a way that's community-led, as opposed to a centralized committee picking who they think the experts are?

How can the scenius — the genius that's in the scene, in the people who all know and respect each other — how can we make that visible?

We ended up working with members of Dao Dao and Layer Labs — Jake Hartnell — to implement something called a **trust graph**. This uses an Ethereum Attestation Service schema for a particular network. You say: here are our criteria for what it means to be a member of this network. You seed that network with validators — the "trusted seed." Those people attest to the people they trust, and in the attestation, they give it a weight. All of that becomes publicly available information.

When those people attest to others, there's a chain of trust. We use the same algorithm Google uses to rank web pages — based on the number of links and their strength — to derive a numerical representation of collective trust for each node in the network.

We had over a hundred people making attestations — a thousand total attestations. From that, we derived the **thirty most trusted people** within the network. They became the evaluators of the local funding programs. They stepped in to offer mentorship, evaluate projects according to criteria, and the total evaluator score for each project determined the matching ratio we provided.

We used this attestation-based network of trust to generate evaluators, then scores, then distribute money according to the will of the network of experts.

We're trying to decenter ourselves. The word you might hear in the Ethereum localism space is **"extitutional"** — where institutions enclose, extitutions are about the relational web of a network. How can we optimize for the collective intelligence embedded in our networks, and use that to channel resources where they'll be most effective?

### Open Machine and the Protocol Underground

**James:** I published under Exhumed. Christy and I, and Paul's crew — we threw the first GFEL in Portland.

That original group focused on bioregional stuff, decentralized manufacturing, and other aspirations. It kind of fractured, and I feel Boulder is really taking the mantle of that really well.

In the meantime, we've put together a publishing apparatus — **Open Machine** — and published the Ethereum Localism book. We wanted to take a meta look at what we'd done right by catalyzing the initial stage of the movement. We realized it was about taking different readings of technology from radically different sides of the space and clashing them together in a provocative way.

We just published an open letter to the Ethereum community — not a manifesto — challenging the community to restage that same process. Think about how different technologists — not just digital technology, but community technology, art, spirituality — how those subcultures have spontaneously converged around values and principles we call the **protocol underground**.

Protocolization is a really important part of underground culture. People who never touch the digital web also engage in protocolization as a tactic. We want to provoke the Ethereum community to think about how those subcultures could contribute to both Ethereum localism and the larger community — to be imaginative and empathic about what technology can be.

The letter is on the ETHBoulder Twitter account. There's also a hard copy circulating.

**Benjamin:** I want to add to that. The Portland crew and Open Machine in particular have been really instrumental in my thinking about open protocols.

For people who are more technical: Ethereum is an open protocol. If you've ever gone into the governance of the Ethereum protocol, you realize there essentially is none. It's mostly a bunch of nerds fighting in a forum, and that's how they arrive at consensus.

But open protocols from a social-philosophical orientation is about how information spreads among people. Looking at underground communities is very instructive. The Open Protocol Research Group and Open Machine have done great analysis of how the early psychedelic movement and the sex-positive movement came up with alternative means of protecting themselves and meeting their own needs.

A great example: **set and setting**. If you've done psychedelics, you know you should keep in mind the context you're bringing and where you are. If you keep those two things in mind, you'll have a better experience. That's a very simple protocol that spreads word of mouth.

Protocol doesn't have to be deterministic. It can be procedural maps of general heuristics that help you do a thing.

With so much that's not working in our current society — giving people both the permission to take direct action and best practices from what other communities have learned — I think **City Repair** is really worth looking at. This was a community where a kid was killed by a driver in their neighborhood. The government wasn't doing anything. So they decided: we're going to shut down the street and create a turnstile covered with art and plants, so drivers have to slow down.

"But the city will never let us do this." Well, there was a cop in the neighborhood. They talked to him: "Could you make sure patrol cars don't come around this weekend?" He said, "The city government is so slow. You should do it."

That collusion with the state — you have to realize every system of authoritarianism is driven by people who are human. This bottoms-up, community-centered approach to direct action that open protocols enable creates the ability for people to **fork that pattern**. "Oh, my community is encountering something similar." Instead of waiting for traditional institutions to adapt, open protocols come from the need to do it ourselves.

Ethereum localism is a place for knowledge commoning — taking patterns that work in one community at the grassroots level and making them available to others. The frame of open protocols makes that possible.

### Q&A

**Audience Member:** How do you decide what open technology to build, with limited resources?

**Sarah:** One area I'm spending time on is the humanitarian aid context. The current administration's funding cuts in the international aid landscape are super urgent and detrimental. I've been on a deep study for about eight months, and it's been quite hopeful — seeing Ethereum ecosystem technology applied to real-world contexts like refugee populations, displaced communities, and conflict zones with cross-border payments and stablecoins.

I also want to encourage everyone to come to the Ethereum Localism track tomorrow, one to five PM at the Riverside community. It's an unconference — show up with something you want to talk about, respond to what feels alive.

The format: a one-hour fishbowl session (five rotating chairs, casual dialogue), then unconference session pitches (one minute each, fifty-minute sessions), two rounds, then harvest learnings in a closing fishbowl.

**Benjamin:** Something I've been calling **credible neutrality through mechanism design**. I'm working on how to decenter individual binary decisions — the kind that break up communities when you can't reach consensus and either have to fork or disband.

Instead of binary decisions — this or that — we embrace **functional pluralism**: the decision can be plural. We don't have to pick one direction. We can pick different directions proportional to the amount of interest people have in pursuing them.

**Audience Member:** If it's guided by problem urgency, there's natural alignment among the most urgent problems.

**Benjamin:** That brings up another important idea: **subsidiarity**. Decision-making should be nested at the most local level where that decision has impact. Part of the reason Localism Fund funded grants programs rather than giving grants to projects directly — we gave $20,000 to Regenerate Cascadia, a nonprofit with its own network of indigenous nations and local communities. Instead of us picking what projects to fund, we gave them full autonomy to determine how to distribute resources. It's not passing the buck — it's distributing agency.

**Audience Member:** Is there a central truth at the heart of Ethereum that you're all chasing? There's a lot of talk of alignment, but it seems to be about logistics — managing, executing, organizing. Is there universal truth behind Ethereum as an asset?

**Benjamin:** I wrote an essay called "What is Ethereum For?" trying to understand if there are universal ethics or values that could bridge across network state to network society movements, Bitcoin maxis, DAO nerds — all the subsets.

I think part of Ethereum's identity is that it really is a neutral substrate. On its face, that doesn't seem valuable — it's just the paper you print on. Does the paper matter?

But **pluralism as a value** means: we believe in a free society where people can determine for themselves, opt in, instead of authoritarian structures imposed from above. Could we have a society diverse enough, plural enough, for many experiments of how society could be organized?

That's what keeps me in Ethereum. Other blockchains can write smart contracts now. But Ethereum doesn't represent one way society could be organized. It's a belief that **we all have a right to consent to how our society is organized**. Ethereum is a space where we can experiment and iterate on that collectively.

**Audience Member:** How do you think about value flows from local to global? The L2 treasure chests funding local projects felt like we'd reversed the value flow — where big box stores extract value from communities, we were getting some back. How much of localism could and should be about keeping value within the community?

**Benjamin:** That is maybe one of the most important and underdeveloped aspects of Ethereum localism.

Citizen Wallet had promising stuff. Burner Wallet was doing point-of-sale. What we need to accelerate **community currency adoption**: it's very hard right now for a non-technical person to issue a token, define its governance, enroll enough people, build a point-of-sale interface, onboard local businesses.

There's a ton of traditional community currency knowledge to apply here. Scott Morris — who's been at all the GFELs — is one of the world's leading experts on this. Ways to get around regulatory constraints — they're called coupons, not money. You can still have a token representing a coupon. I don't know if that legal loophole holds up in court.

But there are success stories of community currencies keeping value circulating locally. I would love to see someone take that baton and create the Salesforce of the decentralized, community-owned currency space. It's that ease of onboarding and governance around the token — the tech hasn't quite been there. I see this as one of the highest-leverage things we could do, but I don't know anyone driving it forward the way I think it should be.

**Audience Member:** How do you think about the tension that we want to be localists but we're more mobile than ever — we're involved in various networks and communities not all in the same place?

**Sarah:** Recognizing our privilege is really important to surface. We all travel internationally and show up at events around the world. It's important to stay centered in place, in our bioregions, and use our learnings to inform the work at the global scale.

**Benjamin:** That was my main pushback on the network nations. They're trying to respond to the network state — affinity-based networks of alignment, globally, with localized clusters of nodes like third spaces all connected. But we are people of place. That really matters.

We can't ignore, just because we're global citizens and part of global networks, that we have a responsibility through our embeddedness in our bioregion.

I wrote an essay called "Citizen: Rights and Responsibilities in the Network Age." Instead of citizenship being conferred by the state, it's conferred by your peers as recognition that you've taken on responsibility and care for some collective. That could be your neighborhood, your Discord server, your family.

We're not singular — "I'm a citizen of the United States." I'm a citizen of this movement. I'm a citizen in my bioregion. That means taking on responsibility for caring for that.

If we split our identity from being only one thing, and recognize we wear many hats in different contexts — all of them important — we need to do both our citizen duties at the global level and take on bioregional citizenship at the same time.

**Sarah:** Come join us tomorrow at Riverside, one to five. We're excited.
