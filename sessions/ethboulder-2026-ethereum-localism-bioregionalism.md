# ETHBoulder 2026: Ethereum Localism & Bioregionalism

**Convergence:** ETHBoulder 2026 (Feb 13–16, Boulder, CO)
**Type:** Panel / facilitated discussion
**Participants:** Sarah Johnstone (permaculturist, bioregionalist, Ethereum community), Benjamin Life (Open Civics DAO co-founder, Localism Fund co-steward, Spirit of the Front Range co-founder)

## Review Summary

Sarah and Benjamin open a session on Ethereum localism by tracing the movement's origins from the General Forum of Ethereum Localism (GFEL) in Portland through to ETHBoulder, and articulating the core values and productive contradictions at the heart of the movement. The session establishes Ethereum localism as occupying the tension between global protocol and place-based community — neither purely local nor abstractly global, but bridging both.

### Key Themes

1. **GFEL Origins and Community Formation** — The General Forum of Ethereum Localism (GFEL), held twice in Portland and then in Boulder, catalyzed the movement. It brought together a "crypto-leftist" and explicitly values-aligned subset of the Web3 community. By giving the movement a name and a space, it helped people find each other. The Portland events are where Benjamin first met Kevin Owocki, despite both living in Boulder. Deep relationships and solidarity have formed from this core group.

2. **The Productive Contradiction** — Ethereum localism sits at the center of a fundamental tension: a global protocol versus lived, place-based realities. The movement refuses to resolve this tension in either direction — it's neither "hyper-local only, screw the global commons" nor "abstracted global coordination that doesn't connect to real everyday lives." Instead, it holds both simultaneously.

3. **Core Values** — Democratic participation, community ownership, cooperativism, peer-to-peer technological architectures that prevent capture by centralized institutions. The combination of sovereignty and care. Global solidarity applied through place-based communities where communities define how technology is used and deployed.

4. **The Bridge Problem** — The central challenge: Ethereum provides a global ledger for coordinating around open source software and public goods, but where is the bridge that makes it relevant for local communities? Until the technology "touches down" in actual places, the values remain aspirational.

5. **Institutional Context** — Multiple overlapping organizations and initiatives:
   - **Open Civics** — A DAO co-founded by Benjamin
   - **Localism Fund** — Ethereum-aligned project funding local public goods
   - **Spirit of the Front Range** — Bioregional nonprofit in Colorado
   - **GFEL** — The catalyzing event series
   - **Gitcoin** — Also credited with helping the community find each other

## Edited Dialogue

**Sarah:** It's really exciting to be here. Let's start out with introductions. I'm Sarah Johnstone. I'm a permaculturist, a bioregionalist, and an active Ethereum member. I'm really passionate about the Ethereum localism community, and I'm excited to be here with Benjamin.

**Benjamin:** Hi, everyone. My name is Benjamin Life. I'm a co-founder of a DAO called Open Civics, and also a co-steward of the Localism Fund, which is an Ethereum-aligned project funding local public goods — we'll talk more about that later. And most recently, a co-founder and steward of the Spirit of the Front Range, which is a bioregional nonprofit here in Colorado.

**Sarah:** I'd love to fill in some context for those attending this event for the first time. Obviously this is the first ETHBoulder, but we had an event last year called the General Forum of Ethereum Localism — GFEL — which I like to think seeded this bigger event we're having now.

Benjamin, can you share some context about that event, where the movement was born in Portland, your experience, and what we're doing here?

**Benjamin:** It's really beautiful to have some of the catalysts of GFEL and the Ethereum localism movement here in the house. I want to shout out Christy, Exhumed, and a few other members of their crew.

Out in Portland, they brought a group of us together for the first time. It was actually where I first met Kevin Owocki, even though we both lived in Boulder. It catalyzed a tremendous amount and set a precedent for what the Ethereum localism community is and what the shared values are.

It really brought together a kind of crypto-leftist, but also a more explicitly values-aligned subset of the Web3 community. By giving it a name and a space, it helped a lot of us find each other. Gitcoin has also done this, but I think the GFEL events — twice in Portland and then here in Boulder — really established this core group of us who have developed deep relationships and solidarity.

**Sarah:** Can you speak to some of those values we hold in the ecosystem?

**Benjamin:** It's hard to talk about the values without first acknowledging the underlying contradiction within Ethereum localism — this tension between a global protocol and the lived realities that each of us are actually embedded in, in specific places.

We have this global ledger that allows us to coordinate and support open source software and public goods. But where is the bridge that actually makes that relevant for local communities? Because until it touches down, I think what a lot of us who got into the space for — the values of democratic participation, community ownership, cooperativism, peer-to-peer technological architectures that prevent capture by centralized institutions — this idea of combining sovereignty and care. I think those are at the core of it for me.

This is inherent to Ethereum, and why I think Ethereum is a place where these values are at home. There is this global solidarity, and then the need to apply those technologies in place-based communities where communities have the sovereignty to define how the technology is used and deployed.

Ethereum localism sits in the center of that contradiction. Instead of saying it's one or the other — it's not hyper-local only, "buy local and screw you to the global commons," nor is it trying to create an abstracted global coordination layer that doesn't meaningfully connect to people's real everyday lives.
