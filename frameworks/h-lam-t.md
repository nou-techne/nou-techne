## Overview
Collective intelligence is the capacity of groups to understand situations, make decisions, and take coordinated action in ways that exceed what any individual member could accomplish alone. It is not the sum of individual intelligences but something that emerges from their interaction.

## Core Premises

### 1. Capability is Systemic (H-LAM/T)
Human capability does not reside purely inside individual brains. It emerges from systems (H-LAM/T framework):
*   **H**umans using
*   **L**anguage
*   **A**rtifacts
*   **M**ethodology
*   in which the human is **T**rained.
Capability lives in the system formed by these elements, not in any single component.

### 2. Three Levels of Work
*   **Level 1:** Primary work (solving immediate problems, producing outputs).
*   **Level 2:** Improving how we work (better methods, better tools).
*   **Level 3:** Improving how we improve (building the capacity to build capacity).
Level 3 has compounding returns and requires patience and infrastructure.

### 3. Nested Intelligence
Intelligence operates at multiple scales: Team -> Organization -> Network -> Ecosystem. Human collective intelligence is a layer within this nested structure. What happens at our scale affects scales above and below.

### 4. Necessary Conditions
*   **Shared Language:** To articulate complex ideas together.
*   **Compatible Methods:** To work in complementary ways.
*   **Appropriate Tools:** To extend capability without creating friction.
*   **Trust:** To share incomplete thinking and acknowledge uncertainty.
*   **Time and Attention:** Coordination requires investment; it cannot be eliminated for efficiency.
*   **Feedback Loops:** To learn from experience.

### 5. The Bootstrapping Discipline
The most effective way to improve is to use your own tools and methods to develop those same tools and methods. This collapses the distance between design and use.

## The Bottleneck
The bottleneck for addressing complex challenges is not individual brilliance—it is **collective capability**. We have invested in individual development while neglecting the practical understanding of how groups think together.

## Beyond Human Systems
Human collective intelligence is a participation in patterns larger and older than our species. The Earth has been coordinating complex systems (forests, watersheds, flocks) for billions of years. We are not inventing coordination; we are learning to participate more skillfully in patterns that have proven their viability across deep time.
