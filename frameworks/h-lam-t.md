# e/H-LAM/T — Collective Intelligence, Situated

## Overview
Collective intelligence is the capacity of groups to understand situations, make decisions, and take coordinated action in ways that exceed what any individual member could accomplish alone. It is not the sum of individual intelligences but something that emerges from their interaction — and from the place where that interaction happens.

## The Framework: e/H-LAM/T

Douglas Engelbart's original H-LAM/T framework (1962) described human capability as systemic — emerging not from individual brains but from the interaction of Humans, Language, Artifacts, Methodology, and Training. Capability lives in the system, not in any single component.

The **e/** prefix extends this framework by situating it in ecological context. Intelligence doesn't float. It lives in watersheds, in seasonal rhythms, in the specific geology and ecology of where work happens. The e/ layer is the environment that holds, constrains, and nourishes every H-LAM/T system.

### e/ — Environment
The ecological and bioregional context in which a capability system operates. Watersheds, seasonal cycles, geological constraints, biological rhythms, social conditions. What the land is doing. What that means for the work.

A venture studio on the Colorado Front Range reads the snowpack, not just the market. February's drought is June's water crisis. The binding constraint is physical before it is financial. The e/ layer makes this visible.

### H — Humans
The practitioners and their evolving capabilities. Individual skills, embodied knowledge, attention, judgment. The people in the room and what they bring.

### L — Language
The shared vocabulary that enables coordination. Technical terms, metaphors, naming conventions. For Techne: REA, patronage, nous, service credits, scenius. Language is infrastructure — it determines what a group can think together.

### A — Artifacts
The physical and digital tools that extend capability. The space, the legal documents, the software, the ventures. And the composable tools that make them legible — Treasury, People, Agreements.

### M — Methodology
The practices and protocols that govern how work happens. The bootstrap discipline: using your own tools to improve your own tools. Democratic governance. Patronage-based allocation. Period close workflows. The methods are the culture made explicit.

### T — Training
The transformation of practitioners through structured practice. Not just skill acquisition but the development of judgment, fluency, and the capacity to perceive patterns across domains. Contemplative grounding. Compositional fluency that compounds with practice.

## Core Premises

### 1. Capability is Systemic and Situated
Capability emerges from the interaction of all six elements — e/H-LAM/T. Remove any one and the system degrades. Ignore the environment and the system becomes brittle, building for conditions that don't exist. The e/ layer is not background. It is the ground from which everything else grows.

### 2. Three Levels of Work
*   **Level 1:** Primary work (solving immediate problems, producing outputs).
*   **Level 2:** Improving how we work (better methods, better tools).
*   **Level 3:** Improving how we improve (building the capacity to build capacity).

Level 3 has compounding returns and requires patience and infrastructure. The e/ layer operates at Level 3 — it doesn't produce outputs directly, but it shapes what kinds of outputs are possible and appropriate.

### 3. Nested Intelligence
Intelligence operates at multiple scales: Team → Organization → Network → Ecosystem → Bioregion → Planet. Human collective intelligence is a layer within this nested structure. The e/ prefix makes the nesting explicit — what happens at our scale affects scales above and below, and we are held by scales we didn't create.

### 4. Necessary Conditions
*   **Shared Language:** To articulate complex ideas together.
*   **Compatible Methods:** To work in complementary ways.
*   **Appropriate Tools:** To extend capability without creating friction.
*   **Trust:** To share incomplete thinking and acknowledge uncertainty.
*   **Time and Attention:** Coordination requires investment; it cannot be eliminated for efficiency.
*   **Feedback Loops:** To learn from experience.
*   **Ecological Awareness:** To read the environment that holds the system and plan accordingly.

### 5. The Bootstrapping Discipline
The most effective way to improve is to use your own tools and methods to develop those same tools and methods. This collapses the distance between design and use. The e/ layer adds a constraint: the bootstrap must be grounded. Tools built without reference to place, season, or ecological reality may improve in isolation but degrade the systems they depend on.

## The Bottleneck
The bottleneck for addressing complex challenges is not individual brilliance — it is **collective capability situated in ecological reality**. We have invested in individual development while neglecting both the practical understanding of how groups think together and the environmental context that makes their thinking relevant.

## Beyond Human Systems
Human collective intelligence is a participation in patterns larger and older than our species. The Earth has been coordinating complex systems — forests, watersheds, mycelial networks, flocks — for billions of years. We are not inventing coordination; we are learning to participate more skillfully in patterns that have proven their viability across deep time.

The e/ prefix honors this. It says: before the Human, before the Language, before the Artifacts — there is the environment that made all of them possible. Intelligence arises from conditions. The bread rises because the conditions are right.

## Lineage

*   **Douglas Engelbart** — H-LAM/T framework, "Augmenting Human Intellect" (1962)
*   **Vannevar Bush** — Memex, "As We May Think" (1945)
*   **Norbert Wiener** — Cybernetics, feedback loops (1948)
*   **J.C.R. Licklider** — Human-computer symbiosis (1960)
*   **Brian Eno** — Scenius: the intelligence of a whole cultural scene
*   **Elinor Ostrom** — Commons governance, polycentric systems
*   **Gregory Bateson** — Ecology of mind, the pattern which connects

The e/ extension situates Engelbart's framework in the longer tradition of ecological thinking — the recognition that all systems, including human capability systems, exist within and depend upon the living systems that hold them.
