## Form Responses (Ready to Submit)

### 1. What is your name or nickname?
**Todd Youngblood**

### 2. What is your email address?
**[Todd to provide — not stored in public repo for privacy]**

### 3. Secondary communication channel of your choice (Telegram, Signal, Matrix, etc.) and your handle or contact information
**Telegram: @todd_y**

### 4. Country
**United States**

### 5. City
**Boulder, Colorado**

### 6. What are you reaching out about?
**Regular Meetups or Workshop series (> 6 times a year)**

> *Rationale: Techne Institute runs regular programming including LearnVibe.Build cohorts, co-working sessions, formation meetings, and community events — well exceeding 6 per year. ETHBoulder is the annual conference, but the ongoing programming is the stronger fit for this category.*

### 7. What stage is this in?
**Newly launched (0–3 months)**

> *Rationale: RegenHub, LCA was filed February 6, 2026. Techne Institute has been operating informally for longer, but the formal cooperative structure is newly launched.*

### 8. Community Background & Track Record

RegenHub is a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association (LCA) filed February 6, 2026, operating as Techne Institute from the third floor in Boulder, Colorado. We are a venture studio structured as a cooperative — providing infrastructure (physical space, legal wrapper, shared resources, and coordination tools) for autonomous ventures building at the intersection of Ethereum, cooperative economics, and regenerative systems.

**What we've built so far:**

- **ETHBoulder 2026** (Feb 13–16): A four-day convergence we co-organized bringing together ~100+ builders, researchers, and community members exploring agent coordination, bioregional Ethereum, cooperative governance, and public goods funding. This was our second annual event.

- **commons.id**: A knowledge-graph-backed living archive for convergence events. Built during a 24-sprint cycle, live at commons.id, with real-time sync from ETHBoulder sessions and Bonfires.ai episodes into a dimensional knowledge graph with a convergence chain (append-only hash chain for contribution integrity).

- **LearnVibe.Build (LVB)**: An education program within Techne Institute focused on AI-augmented learning and building. First cohort completed curriculum design; second cohort in planning.

- **Patronage Accounting System**: Open-source cooperative infrastructure (github.com/nou-techne/habitat) implementing REA (Resource, Event, Agent) ontology for patronage tracking, capital accounts, and multi-stakeholder allocation — designed for Colorado LCA compliance under IRC 704(b).

- **$CLOUD Service Credits**: A mutual credit system backed by compute resources (compute, bandwidth, long-term memory, short-term memory), designed under Colorado's cooperative securities exemption. Enables continuous economic participation via Superfluid streams.

- **Collective Intelligence Agent (Nou)**: An operational AI agent serving as the cooperative's collective intelligence layer — synthesizing decisions, maintaining institutional memory, coordinating across ventures, and publishing a public journal at the-habitat.org.

**Community:**
Our community includes data engineers, cooperative attorneys, designers, AI researchers, and regenerative practitioners. We operate a three-tier membership model (Community → Co-working → Cooperative) that makes the path from participation to governance legible and earned. Our public benefit statement, filed with the state of Colorado, declares our purpose as "cultivating scenius" — the collective intelligence inherent in place.

**Key partnerships:**
- Bonfires.ai (distributed knowledge graph infrastructure)
- Allo Capital / Gitcoin ecosystem (public goods funding)
- Spirit of the Front Range (bioregional nonprofit)
- SporkDAO (Colorado cooperative peer)

### 9. Main Topics and Themes
**Selected:**
- ☑ DAOs & Governance
- ☑ AI & Ethereum
- ☑ Onboarding beginner users or developers
- ☑ Regulations & Legal

> *Rationale: Our core work spans cooperative governance (LCA structure, patronage accounting), AI coordination (agent swarms, collective intelligence), education (LearnVibe.Build onboarding new builders), and legal innovation (Colorado cooperative securities exemptions, LCA formation).*

### 10. Event or Initiative Name
**Techne Institute / RegenHub, LCA — Boulder Ethereum Community Hub**

**commons.id** (Knowledge graph and convergence archive)

## Notes for Todd

- **This is a Google Form, not a Google Doc** — you'll need to manually enter these responses into the form linked above.
- **Email address** is left blank for you to fill in.
- **Category choice:** I selected "Regular Meetups or Workshop series (> 6 times a year)" because ongoing Techne programming is the strongest case. If you'd prefer "Conference, Hackathon, or other annual event" (positioning ETHBoulder specifically), let me know and I'll adjust the framing.
- **Stage:** "Newly launched" reflects the LCA filing date. If you want to emphasize the longer informal history, "Active (3–12 months)" could work too.
- The Community Background section is the most important — it tells the story of what we've built and why Ethereum Everywhere support makes sense for Boulder.
