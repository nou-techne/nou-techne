## 1. Overview & Motivation

**Why would establishing an Ethereum Community Hub in your city or region be impactful?**

Boulder sits at 5,430 feet, where the Great Plains meet the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. It's a place where ecology and technology have always been in conversation — and where Ethereum is starting to take root in the landscape, not just the internet.

Three things make this bioregion ready for a Community Hub:

**The community is already here and building.**

We just wrapped the inaugural **ETHBoulder** (Feb 14–16, 2026) — three days of talks, workshops, unconference sessions, and rooftop discussions bringing together 100+ builders, researchers, and community members around agent coordination, bioregional Ethereum, cooperative governance, and public goods funding. Last year, the **General Forum for Ethereum Localism (GFEL)** gathered in Boulder with a similar spirit — exploring what Ethereum looks like when it's grounded in place. ETHBoulder grew out of that energy.

**RegenHub, LCA** — Colorado's newest Limited Cooperative Association, filed February 6, 2026 — currently operates from the second floor of 1515 Walnut Street in downtown Boulder, with the third floor planned as an expansion for Techne Institute programming. The Community Hub would span both floors. The second floor is already active as a co-working area and event venue, and the third floor expansion is in final planning. The cooperative structure isn't incidental — it's the thesis: Ethereum infrastructure should be governed by the communities that use it.

Boulder's broader ecosystem includes CU Boulder (researchers like Nathan Schneider working on platform cooperativism and digital governance), the Gitcoin/Allo Capital ecosystem (headquartered at RegenHub), and a dense network of climate tech, AI, and regenerative finance practitioners. The Front Range corridor from Denver to Fort Collins is one of the fastest-growing tech regions in the country, and Boulder is its cultural center.

**What's missing — and what a hub would unlock.**

Boulder has the people and the energy, but no permanent community space with a visible Ethereum presence that newcomers can walk into. The university produces hundreds of CS and engineering graduates each year who are Ethereum-curious but have no local on-ramp. Digital nomads passing through (there are a lot of them — Boulder's that kind of place) have no Ethereum-specific landing pad. Founders building on Ethereum work in isolation when they could be collaborating a block from Pearl Street.

Hosting an Ethereum Community Hub at Techne would make the invisible visible — giving Boulder's thriving but informal Ethereum community a legible home while connecting it to the global network. Techne wouldn't be exclusively Ethereum-branded, but Ethereum values and infrastructure are central to what we're building, and we'd welcome the partnership and visibility.

**What else exists nearby:**
- Galvanize Boulder (general tech co-working, no Ethereum focus)
- CU Boulder Engineering Center (academic, limited community access)
- Various co-working spaces (WeWork, Industrious) — generic, no mission alignment

None of these connect Ethereum builders, onboard new contributors, or link local work to the global ecosystem. That's the gap.

## 2. Team & Management

**Who are the core members of your team?**

The RegenHub organizing team brings together technologists, community builders, designers, and civic practitioners — all rooted in Boulder and the Front Range bioregion.

**Todd Youngblood — Ventures & Operations Steward**
Data engineer and IT MBA with deep experience in information systems architecture, cooperative formation, and community organizing. Todd led the six-month formation process for RegenHub, LCA — navigating Colorado cooperative law, drafting governance structures, and building the operational framework. He's the primary steward of the physical space at 1515 Walnut (15–20 hours/week, M/W/F in-office), managing co-working operations, event programming, and venture development.

**Kevin Owocki — Capital Allocation & Ecosystem Strategy**
Co-founder and Executive Steward of Gitcoin (the largest public goods funding platform in Ethereum, distributing $60M+ to open source projects) and Allo Capital. Kevin has been a core contributor to RegenHub's formation from the start — bringing deep expertise in capital allocation mechanisms, public goods funding design, and ecosystem-level coordination. He provides strategic direction, relationship bridges across the global Ethereum network, and hands-on thinking about how cooperative economics and Ethereum infrastructure can reinforce each other. Boulder-based and actively involved in the community.

**Lucian Hymer — Engineering & Identity Infrastructure**
Former lead engineer at Gitcoin Passport (passportxyz), the decentralized identity verification system used across the Ethereum ecosystem. Lucian brings deep technical expertise in identity, sybil resistance, and decentralized systems — and a hacker's sensibility about building things that actually work. Boulder-based and actively contributing to the local Ethereum community.

**Jonathan Borichevskiy — Independent Developer**
Indie developer (jon.bo) focused on tools for human connection and cognitive infrastructure. Jonathan builds at the intersection of how the mind works and how we connect with each other — a natural fit for a community hub grounded in collective intelligence. Boulder-based, deeply embedded in the local builder community.

**Aaron Gabriel Neyer — Community & Programs**
Formerly of Google, graduate of Naropa University (Boulder's contemplative education institution), now at CU Boulder. Aaron co-organized ETHBoulder and stewards Spirit of the Front Range, a local nonprofit connecting bioregional ecology to technology practice. He co-designed the LearnVibe.Build curriculum and brings a framework he calls "Amplifying Aliveness" — the principle that technology should amplify what's most alive in communities. His strength is making complex ideas accessible and creating spaces where people actually want to show up.

**Savannah Kruger — Neighborhood & Placemaking**
Founder of the Neighborhood Village Project (NVP), a program for neighborhood-scale community building that grew out of Cabin DAO's Neighborhood Accelerator. Savannah brings experience co-leading international social impact accelerators, managing community at Impact Hub Boulder, facilitating sustainability programs at Harvard, and organizing neighborhoods for placemaking projects with City Repair Boulder. She runs weekly community rituals in Boulder (Park Prance, Boulder Food Exchange) and has years of experience in intentional co-living. She's the connective tissue between Techne and Boulder's neighborhood-level community.

**Neil Mackay Yarnal — Design**
Designer at local*, bringing visual and experience design expertise to the hub's identity, events, and communications. Neil ensures that the community hub is not just functional but welcoming and legible — from event materials to spatial design to digital presence.

**Benjamin Ross — Civic Infrastructure & Bioregional Commons**
Co-founder of OpenCivics, a movement for open civic innovation that has distributed $361K+ to civic innovators across six community-led grant rounds. Benjamin also stewards Spirit of the Front Range alongside Aaron. He brings the civic technology perspective — participatory governance, bioregional coordination, and commons-based infrastructure design. His work directly connects the Ethereum Community Hub to Boulder's broader civic ecosystem.

**Additional team:**
- **Pote Law Firm** — Legal counsel specializing in Colorado cooperative law, currently drafting the operating agreement and bylaws
- **Nou (Collective Intelligence Agent)** — An operational AI agent maintained by the cooperative that handles institutional memory, documentation, knowledge graph management, and coordination across ventures. Maintains the public journal at the-habitat.org and manages commons.id.

## 3. Venue & Location

**Do you have an existing venue for the proposed hub?**

Yes — partially operational, with expansion in final planning.

### Address and Neighborhood Description

**1515 Walnut Street, Third Floor, Boulder, Colorado 80302**

Downtown Boulder, one block south of Pearl Street Mall — the pedestrian heart of the city. The neighborhood is dense with restaurants, cafes, creative businesses, and foot traffic. It's where people naturally end up, whether they live here or are visiting.

Boulder itself sits at the ecological edge where the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountain Front Range. The city has a long history of environmental leadership, progressive policy, and technology innovation. The bioregion shapes the culture: people here think in systems, care about place, and show up for their neighbors. That's the soil an Ethereum Community Hub grows in.

The building houses a vertical ecosystem:
- **Second Floor (RegenHub Co-working) — Operational now:** Co-working cooperative and venture studio — startups, founders, and builders with dedicated desks, shared resources, and event space. This is where RegenHub currently operates day-to-day.
- **Third Floor (Techne Institute) — Planned expansion:** The dedicated Community Hub space — commons area for members, teaching space for workshops, studio for building, quiet room for focused work, sauna and cold plunge for restoration and community bonding. The lease is in final negotiation; the space was recently cleared and is ready for build-out.
- **Rooftop:** Gathering space for events, happy hours, and the kind of informal conversations where ideas cross-pollinate (the Swarm Wealth rooftop session at ETHBoulder 2026 happened here, looking out at the Flatirons)

The second floor is furnished and operational today. Community Hub programming can begin immediately using the existing space. The third floor expansion will provide dedicated, purpose-built hub infrastructure as the lease is finalized — expected within 60 days.

### Accessibility

- **Transit:** Boulder's SKIP and HOP bus routes stop within one block. The Flatiron Flyer (FF1) runs express to Denver and DIA. RTD connects to the broader Front Range. Bike infrastructure is excellent — Boulder consistently ranks among the most bike-friendly cities in the US.
- **Safety:** Downtown Boulder is one of the safest urban areas in Colorado. Pearl Street is well-lit, pedestrian-friendly, and actively patrolled.
- **Inclusivity:** Community tier membership has no gatekeeping — show up, participate, you're in. Events and education are designed to welcome people with zero prior Ethereum experience. LearnVibe.Build specifically targets onboarding new builders through structured, supportive cohorts.
- **ADA:** Elevator access to all floors.

## 7. Community Engagement & Impact

**How we keep people connected:**

- **Telegram (techne.institute)** — Daily real-time communication. Formation updates, event announcements, community discussion.
- **commons.id** — All events and contributions captured in a searchable knowledge graph. Not just a record — a living coordination tool where members can see what's happening, who's working on what, and where to plug in.
- **Public journal (the-habitat.org)** — Regular reflections on formation, patronage design, and collective intelligence. Transparent by default.
- **GitHub (nou-techne)** — Session notes, strategy docs, governance artifacts. All public.

**Keeping people engaged:**

- **Membership as journey:** Community → Co-working → Cooperative. The path is visible and earned. People know where they stand and what's next.
- **Patronage tracking:** Our four-factor formula (40% labor / 30% revenue / 20% cash / 10% community) makes every kind of contribution visible — not just money. If you show up and teach a workshop, that counts. If you document a session, that counts.
- **Member-led initiatives:** People propose and lead their own workshops, reading groups, project teams. The cooperative structure gives members real ownership, not just a seat.
- **Open governance:** Formation meetings are open to anyone. Raise concerns, propose changes, give feedback. Quarterly reporting will include community surveys and impact metrics.

**Growing the community:**

- **ETHBoulder** as annual on-ramp — brings new faces each year; the hub converts visitors into regulars
- **LearnVibe.Build** as pipeline — structured cohorts turn curious newcomers into capable builders
- **CU Boulder outreach** — guest lectures, career events, student group partnerships
- **Digital nomad network** — Boulder draws a steady stream of tech-savvy visitors. Some stay.
- **Word of mouth** — Boulder is ~105,000 people. In a city this size, reputation is everything.

- **180 days:** $30,000+/mo (education, venture studio, grants online)
- **12 months:** ~$200,000 annual

The cooperative structure is the sustainability engine: members are owners. They have financial stake in the hub's success, not just consumer interest. Revenue diversity — space, education, venture services, events — means no single source is a single point of failure.

**Startup capital:** Two investor members committed $50K each ($100K total) to fund the ramp period. Structured as investor member contributions under the Colorado LCA — limited preferred returns, no governance control, no equity in ventures. Capital serves the cooperative, not the other way around.

**Grant strategy:** The EE grant targets community programming and education only. Additional applications planned for civic innovation (local/state) and Ethereum ecosystem grants.
