## 1. Overview & Motivation

**Why would establishing an Ethereum Community Hub in your city or region be impactful?**

Boulder, Colorado sits at the intersection of three converging forces that make it uniquely positioned for an Ethereum Community Hub: a deep well of technical talent, a progressive cooperative legal framework, and a growing movement to ground decentralized technology in place-based community.

**The local ecosystem is already active and growing:**

- **ETHBoulder** just completed its second annual convergence (Feb 13–16, 2026), drawing 100+ builders, researchers, and community practitioners for four days of sessions on agent coordination, bioregional Ethereum, cooperative governance, and public goods funding. Sessions ranged from technical deep-dives on agent swarm orchestration to facilitated dialogues on Ethereum at the bioregion level.

- **RegenHub, LCA** — Colorado's newest Limited Cooperative Association, filed February 6, 2026 — already operates from the third floor of 1515 Walnut Street in downtown Boulder. The space functions as a co-working area, event venue, and educational hub. The cooperative structure isn't incidental — it's the thesis: that Ethereum infrastructure should be governed by the communities that use it.

- **Boulder's broader tech community** includes CU Boulder (with researchers like Nathan Schneider working on platform cooperativism and digital governance), the Gitcoin/Allo Capital ecosystem (headquartered locally), and a dense network of climate tech, AI, and regenerative finance practitioners.

**What's missing — and what a Community Hub would unlock:**

Boulder has the people and the energy, but no permanent, branded Ethereum presence that newcomers can find, walk into, and participate in. The university produces hundreds of CS and engineering graduates annually who are Ethereum-curious but have no local on-ramp. Digital nomads passing through Boulder (a significant population given the city's lifestyle appeal) have no Ethereum-specific landing pad. Local founders building on Ethereum work in isolation when they could be collaborating.

An Ethereum Community Hub at Techne Institute would make the invisible visible — turning a thriving but informal Ethereum community into a legible, accessible, globally connected node in the Ethereum Everywhere network.

**Existing complementary spaces:**
- Galvanize Boulder (general tech co-working, no Ethereum focus)
- CU Boulder Engineering Center (academic, limited community access)
- Various co-working spaces (WeWork, Industrious) — generic, no mission alignment

None of these serve the specific function of connecting Ethereum builders, onboarding new contributors, or linking local work to the global Ethereum ecosystem. That's the gap.

## 2. Team & Management

**Who are the core members of your team?**

**Todd Youngblood — Ventures & Operations Steward**
Data engineer with deep experience in information systems architecture, cooperative formation, and community organizing. Todd led the six-month formation process for RegenHub, LCA — navigating Colorado cooperative law, drafting governance structures, and building the operational framework. He serves as the primary steward of the physical space at 1515 Walnut Street (15–20 hours/week, M/W/F in-office), managing co-working operations, event programming, and venture development. Todd's background spans data engineering, systems architecture, and organizational design — he brings both the technical depth to support Ethereum builders and the operational discipline to run a sustainable community space.

**Aaron Gabriel Neyer — Community & Programs**
Co-organizer of ETHBoulder and steward of Spirit of the Front Range, a local nonprofit connecting bioregional ecology to technology practice. Aaron brings deep facilitation experience, community-building expertise, and a framework he calls "Amplifying Aliveness" — the principle that technology should amplify what's most alive in communities. He co-designed the LearnVibe.Build curriculum and leads community programming, event facilitation, and participant onboarding. Aaron's strength is making complex ideas accessible and creating spaces where diverse participants feel invited to contribute.

**Kevin Owocki — Strategic Advisor & Investor Member**
Co-founder of Gitcoin and Allo Capital. Kevin brings unparalleled connections to the global Ethereum ecosystem, public goods funding infrastructure, and experience scaling community-driven projects. As an investor member of RegenHub, Kevin provides strategic guidance, ecosystem visibility, and bridge connections between Boulder's local community and the broader Ethereum network. His involvement signals credibility and opens doors that would otherwise take years to access.

**Additional team capacity:**
- **Jeff Pote + Katie (Pote Law Firm)** — Legal counsel specializing in Colorado cooperative law, currently drafting RegenHub's operating agreement and bylaws
- **Nou (Collective Intelligence Agent)** — An operational AI agent maintained by the cooperative that handles institutional memory, documentation, knowledge graph management, and coordination across ventures. Nou maintains the public journal at the-habitat.org and manages commons.id, the knowledge graph infrastructure.

## 3. Venue & Location

**Do you have an existing venue for the proposed hub?**

Yes. The venue is operational today.

### Address and Neighborhood Description

**1515 Walnut Street, Third Floor, Boulder, Colorado 80302**

The building is located in the heart of downtown Boulder, one block south of the Pearl Street Mall — Boulder's pedestrian Main Street and the cultural center of the city. The neighborhood is dense with restaurants, cafes, shops, and creative businesses. It's where locals gather and where visitors naturally gravitate.

The building houses a vertical ecosystem:
- **Third Floor (Techne Institute):** The primary hub space — commons area for members, teaching space for cohorts and workshops, studio for building, quiet room for focused work, plus sauna and cold plunge for restoration and community bonding
- **Second Floor (RegenHub Co-working):** Co-working cooperative and venture studio — startups, founders, and builders with dedicated desks and shared resources
- **Rooftop:** Community gathering space for events, happy hours, and the kind of informal conversations where relationships form and ideas cross-pollinate (the Swarm Wealth rooftop session at ETHBoulder 2026 happened here)

The space is currently furnished and operational. The third floor was recently cleared and reconfigured for Techne Institute programming. No construction, renovation, or build-out is required — the hub can begin hosting Ethereum Community Hub programming immediately.

### Accessibility

- **Transit:** Boulder's SKIP and HOP bus routes stop within one block. The Flatiron Flyer (FF1) provides direct express service to Denver and Denver International Airport. RTD bus service connects to the broader Front Range. Bike infrastructure is excellent — Boulder consistently ranks among the most bike-friendly cities in the US.
- **Safety:** Downtown Boulder is one of the safest urban areas in Colorado. The Pearl Street corridor is well-lit, pedestrian-friendly, and actively patrolled. The neighborhood has a strong culture of street-level community presence.
- **Inclusivity:** The three-tier membership model (Community → Co-working → Cooperative) ensures the space is accessible at every level. Community tier has no gatekeeping — show up, participate, you're in. Events and educational programming are designed to welcome newcomers with no prior Ethereum experience. The LearnVibe.Build program specifically targets onboarding new builders through structured, supportive cohorts.
- **ADA:** The building has elevator access to all floors.
